<p>this should be sent yearly.  for those who don't know him, Nat went from
tossing his unwanted Chinese food into the Bemis hall or out the window,
to founding the Ximian company and living the glamorous "internet
professional" lifestyle.  you can too!

Subject: advice to a young mit student

Fellow ugly bags of mostly water,

  Attached is a document I wrote a few months ago, just before
the end of last term.  Reading back on it, it's largely didactic slop,
but I thought I'd forward it along anyways.  For your viewing
pleasure and so on.

        Advice to a Young MIT Student

Nat Friedman <xxx at nat.org>

Here I am, a few weeks from graduation, with no clue what's next for
me, but with the knowledge that, in a handful of days, my time at MIT
will be no more.  So what I'd like to do is to pass along what I can
as a sort of legacy.  Whether what I have to say is valuable or not is
another matter entirely, but I thought I'd shit out what I could and
let the readership (that would be you) sort it out.

This is a list of some of the things I learned at MIT which I think
could be useful to those of you just starting out, or maybe even to
those of you most of the way through.  A lot of what I have to say may
not apply to you, or you may not agree with it, or I may just be
flat-out wrong.  Take it or leave it as you like.

I decided to summarize what I have to say in a set of rules.  Of
course, I'm guilty of violating my own rules pretty frequently, so
it's probably a bit of a misnomer to call them "rules," but
"guidelines" didn't seem quite right either, and so there you have it.

So, to cut to the proverbial chase...

Rule #1: Don't panic.

  I think "don't panic" qualifies as the numero uno life skill I
  picked up at MIT.

  Coming to MIT, most people are faced with more work than they
  have ever had to do in their lives.  And for many of them, the
  first instinct is to panic: "Great jumped-up Jesus on a
  double-ended dildo, there is NO FUCKING WAY I can get all this
  stuff done!"  And independent of the MIT courseload, you'll
  find that lots of people -- in school and out there in the
  real world -- live their lives in a state of constant panic.
  Maybe it's not a hindrance to them (and for some, it encites
  them to work harder), but it certainly doesn't make them any
  fun to be with, and it's not a fun way to live.

  Even in the closing days of my last term here, I have a
  buttload of things to get done before they'll hand over my
  degrees and my first impulse is to loosen my sphincters and
  start screaming.

  So here's my advice: make a list of the things you have to do.
  Figure out which one needs to get done first.  If there are a
  bunch of tasks of equal priority, choose the one you can get
  done fastest -- this will give you a feeling of some
  accomplishment earlier on and reduce the panic factor -- put
  everything else out of your head, and go at it.

Rule #2: Never refuse a breath mint.

Rule #3: Learn to write good email.

  I cannot overstress the importance of this one.

  For increasingly few of you, coming to MIT is the first time
  you are exposed to a culture in which a large portion of your
  communication occurs over email.  So it is very much to your
  advantage to learn to express yourself clearly and in an
  appealing way.  When you're talking to someone face-to-face,
  you don't want to slur your words, spit in their face, and pee
  on their shoes (well maybe you do, but it's preferable to be
  able to control the appropriate sphincters than to have them
  control you).  Along the same lines, you shouldn't write
  poorly-structured emails filled with typos, spelling errors,
  sloppy formatting and offensively baroque signatures.

  Email is so important and there are so many little ways you
  can screw up that I've written a bunch of subrules on this
  topic.

  Subrule #1

    Get to the point.  If you don't have a lot to say, you
    don't need to do a lot of typing to say it.

  Subrule #2

    If you're trying to get something out of someone via
    email, the first word in your mail should be 'you.'
    This is one I learned from Bob Metcalfe during a talk
    he gave here a couple years ago.  Chances are, if
    you're trying to get someone's attention, and they're
    a busy person, they don't really want to read a whole
    paragraph about you and your needs before you get to
    the point, namely: what's in it for them.

  Subrule #3

    Use spell check.  Bad spelling just makes you look
    stupid, no matter how smart you are.  If you use emacs
    to write your mail, you can type 'M-x ispell-buffer'
    to check the spelling in your entire mail.  Type 'M-$'
    to spell check the word under the cursor.  With this
    kind of mechanical assistance, there's no excuse for
    peppering your mails with spelling errors.

  Subrule #4

    Most people read their mail at Athena, which displays
    the text of the mail using a fixed-width font.
    However, a non-negligible number of people use Outlook
    or Eudora, which use a variable-width font.  Make sure
    that the presentation of your mail doesn't depend on
    it being displayed in either of these environments.
    This means that you should never, ever write HTML mail
    like Netscape Mail sometimes sends.

    I use emacs's indented-text-mode quite a lot (I'm
    using it now, in fact); this generally works out in
    both environments and looks ok, although you have to
    be careful about tab widths.

    This subrule pretty much eliminates the possibility of
    using ASCII art, which brings me to the next subrule.

  Subrule #5

    Keep your signature short and information-rich.
    Mailing lists and, in fact, all of email space have a
    poor enough signal-to-noise ratio as it is; don't
    further pollute it by filling your signature with
    idiotic ASCII art and moronic song lyrics.  No one
    cares.

  Subrule #6

    Do not hyphenate the word 'email.'  Hyphenation should
    be reserved for compound adjectives (such as
    anal-retentive) and compound words which have not yet
    entered the mainstream vocabulary.  Email has entered
    the mainstream vocabulary.  Don't hyphenate it.

  Subrule #7

    Don't forward crap.  The general rule is: when in
    doubt, don't pass something along.  Forwarding chain
    letters is a definite faut pas, and everyone has
    already received the majority of the forwards that are
    kicking around several times, and so no one wants
    their inbox flooded with the same old stuff.  I
    remember one week I received the same stupid chain
    letter over a dozen times, three of them from MIT
    mailing lists.

    Unfortunately there's no sure-fire way to know what's
    old-hat and what's genuinely new and funny except
    experience.  But as a starter, go to
    www.urbanlegends.com and read all of the stuff there.
    We've all seen most of that stuff a dozen times
    already, so if you're ever tempted to pass it along,
    don't.

  What most of these rules come down to is this: Be careful and
  neat about what you do.  When I was learning to program (which
  I'm still doing, every day), I noticed that all of the hackers
  I really admired were very meticulous and careful about their
  work.  So I strive to emulate them (in that regard, anyways),
  and it seems to payoff well.  So I recommend you approach
  email with the same sort of attitude.

Rule #4: Get the fuck off campus.

  I find it really strange, the number of MIT students that
  never leave campus.  Boston is really a superb city, and it's
  downright depressing that so many MIT students never see it.

Rule #5: Eschew extraneous nerdspeak.

  One day I was talking to a twinkie friend of mine and he said
  to me: ``I seem to have lost thermal regulation.''  Now the
  thing of it is, what the hell was he trying to say?  Was it
  ``My radiator is broken,'' or ``I lost my coat,'' or ``I have
  a fever'' ?  So in trying to sound intelligent, he really was
  conveying a lot less information than he could have had he not
  felt obligated to talk like a dork.

  The point is that English has been evolving for thousands of
  years, and we can communicate very specific ideas very
  succinctly just by using regular day-to-day language.
  Nerdspeak is often a lot less precise than normal parlance
  (and furthermore it contributes to linguistic stratification).
  So when sounding like a dork doesn't contribute to what you're
  trying to say, don't do it.

  I should say a little more about this.  One thing you'll
  notice about MIT is that, for whatever reason, there's this
  huge portion of the population that all talk in exactly the
  same didactic, preachy way.  I guess they all keep to
  themselves or something, because no one seems to have ever
  told these people just how obnoxious this is.  So I'm telling
  you now: give it up.  Move on.  Sometimes personality is more
  important than intelligence.

Rule #6: If you spend a lot of time with your computer, keep dental
        floss near the keyboard.

  Just trust me on this one.

Rule #7: At MIT, attitude is cheap.

  Don't think you can get by solely by virtue of your jaded
  outlook.  They sell bitterness by the truckload here.

Rule #8: Take an attitude of entitlement with your professors.

  For some reason, a lot of people find their professors
  intimidating or even menacing.  And I did too, for a year or
  so.  But what you have to understand is, dealing with you --
  teaching you, helping you, answering your questions, and
  addressing your concerns -- that's their job!  Just like you
  shouldn't feel nervous about asking for a big mac at
  McDonald's, don't hesitate to approach your professors.

  And should it ever come to this, you have my permission to use
  the phrase "Silence, you bombastic simpleton!  I demand your
  professorial subservience!"

Rule #9: Learn to deal with underspecified problems.

  I guess this is obvious, but most problems in life seem to be
  underspecified.  That's not how it works in school, though,
  for some reason.  Which fact, I think, does students a great
  injustice, as far as preparing them for the real world.  But
  now I'm getting outside the scope of this document.
