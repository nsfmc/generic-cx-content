          <p>Futurism stressed its own transience from the begining. It made it clear
          that even futurism, as it was when originally conceived, was subject to
          radical change by progressively newer futurists. This gamble makes
          architecture and anything permanent at risk of appearing
          antiquated any time  a new round of futurism appears. How then, does a
          place like MIT respond to this uncertainty? How does MIT assert a
          futuristic aesthetic despite this tenuous transience?</p>
          
          <p>Signage around MIT has a diverse and exciting variety that echoes
          not only its transience but also MIT's desire to reconcile it's classic
          background with its cutting edge connotation. Even in the photo to the
          right, there is an obvious clash between the classic feel of the word
          TechTalk and the MIT logo. The desire to confront this clash in
          different ways is a strange, almost hesitant, attempt to embrace
          the nature of futurism.</p>

        <h2>Reconciliation</h2>

        <div class="copy">
          <p>From the perspective of a proper futurist, MIT is plagued by the
          remnants of an antiquated aesthetic that is at odds with an
          ostensibly functional identity that takes root everywhere. Just as
          Marinetti feared a more futurist generation, <q>exasperated by our
          daring [6]</q> and <q>craving for the new [7]</q>, MIT yearns for an
          update. Instead of expressing disgust for past aesthetics, it tries
          unsuccessfully to subvert and subdue  without eliminating them.</p>
        
        <h3>mens room</h3>
          <p>This sign for a bathroom in the infinite corridor is such an
          example of MIT trying to resolve its push towards functionality above
          its desire for tradition. The result is redundancy that is patently
          inharmonious.</p>

          <p>The use of two distinctly contrasting signs would appear to be an
          indicator that there <em>is</em> genuine disgust with the older
          style. A new modern style, replete with sans serif lettering and
          pictograms underscored with braille lettering, seems to call into
          question the efficacy of the lettering on the door. By its nature, the
          black placard announces that it is more useful than the door
          alone could be. The observer can only imagine that the lettering
          on the door is in case there should be any confusion between the
          bathroom and the adjacent maintenance closet.</p>

          <h3>Engraving</h3>
          
          <p>Nowhere is MIT's neo-classic heritage more apparent than in the
          various engravings about campus. Engravings in corner stones symbolize
          permanence, finality, stability and longevity. How is this futurist?
          These ideas would seem to directly contradict the inherent
          transience of futurism![6]</p>
          
          <p>These engravings are significant because they are often overridden
          by newer, more transient signage. That is, while these relics of
          classical identification remain, they are often subdued by highly
          visible, readily identified signs placed elsewhere. An example of
          this is the Zesiger Center entrance. It features an engraved facade
          that is hardly visible when compared  to the sign at the front
          desk.</p>

        </div>

        <img src="johnson.jpg" title="entrance to Johnson/Zesiger Center" />
        <img src="daper.jpg" title="Daper entrance sign" />
        <img src="staff.jpg" title="Daper employee shirt" />
        <div class="copy">
          <h3>DAPER</h3>
          
          <p>The Department of Athletics is unique in that while being modern,
          it holds on to various classical themes.  Its own visual identity is
          unrelated to the engravings that appear at its entryway and only
          marginally to the uniforms that its employees wear, save the
          similarity in color.</p>
          
          <p>The visual identity that the department portrays is disjoint from
          the identification that its buildings maintains. This seems to be
          both an indication of the transience of the department and of the
          stability of the physical structures. By dissociating the athletic
          center from the department, the department portrays its own image,
          fresh and exuberant, uninhibited by the classic name tag of its
          domicile.</p>

          <p>And the imagery is modern, thoroughly. The typeface used in the
          main entrance sign appears to be "Futura," a highly geometric font
          that is matched with the new MIT logo, whose guiding design principle
          is <q>innovation and surprise [8].</q> The signage set in hazy
          plastic above a metal substrate alluding to a nonexistent
          transparency.</p>
          
          <p>In contrast with other locations, the Zesiger Center contrasts by
          rejecting the classical concept of engraving to an extreme; placing
          lettering not within, but outside of a high contrast background. The look is
          futuristic and sleek, the effect is of a veiled transparency with
          clear letters inexplicably extruding from their opaque sign.</p>
          
          <p>In a way, the department's rejection of the classic and embracing
          of the futuristic is evident in their apparel. By completely
          rejecting the unifying identity provided by the signage in the
          building in favor of a prosaic sans-serif font on their uniforms, the
          Athletics department seems to indicate that almost <em>anything</em>
          would be preferable to the chiseled lettering that graces the
          building's facade.</p>

        <h2>stata</h2>
        <img src="stata sandwich.jpg" title="Frank Gehry no longer permitted to make sandwiches for grandchildren" />

        <div class="copy">

          <p>As one of the newest building on campus, the Stata Center is MIT's
          futurist flagship. Currently preserved in its mostly original state,
          it retains its exclusively futurist aesthetic entirely. Loaded with
          sharp movement, mixed materials and the brash movement that is
          organic in its unabashed mechanism. It is a mess of movement and
          reflects Sant'Elia's <em>messagio</em> so well.</p>

          <blockquote>The house of cement, iron and glass, without carved or
          painted ornament, rich only in the inherent beauty of its lines and
          modelling, extraordinarily brutish in its mechanical
          simplicity...[2]</blockquote> 
      
          <p>Stata's decor appears to derive purely from the aesthetic of the
          materials used to create it. So it is not surprising that signage in
          and around stata should also have the same aesthetic. What makes the
          signage different is its ability to both hide and announce itself by
          taking advantage of its material properties.</p>

          <p>These examples that I present are instances where Stata shines in
          its <q>boldness and simplicity [3]</q> and also in how it has
          pioneered its own futurist design. I begin with the metal MIT on
          the Vassar Street side of the Stata Center.</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <img src="stata.jpg" title="MIT Sign outside 32 Vassar Street (near Main Street)" />
        <img src="hidden mit.jpg" title="MIT Sign hidden by its own reflection" />

        <div class="copy">  <h3>Metallic MIT sign</h3> <p>This sign is almost
        entirely reflective! It combines two elements that are present on other
        institute signage: color and engraving. On first impression, the sign
        is perhaps invisible. When seen from the right angle, it appears to
        vanish in its surroundings and when seen at any angle the viewer is
        perpetually aware that they are not looking at the sign, but instead
        the environment that surrounds it. In a way, the sign has many of the
        same qualities that Boccioni's <em>Development of a Bottle in
        Space</em> has, namely that <q>the viewer is immobilized at a single
        vantage point, [9]</q> or risks not seeing it at all.</p>

          <p>The color debossing is the sign's attempt at permanence. While the
          letters MIT could be temporary, there is no way to remove the words
          <q>Stata Center</q> from the I. The Center's permanence in MIT is
          guaranteed, even if the institution is not. The engraving would appear
          to be an artifact or imitation of classic engravings around campus,
          but the color changes that.  By not being reflective, instead,
          revealing a mysteriously yellow substrate, the classic sense of
          <em>engraving</em> has given way to a modern <em>debossing</em> in a
          bright, matte and surreptitiously unmetallic yellow. This embracing
          of <em>the different</em> is decidedly futurist for both its
          rejection of prior methods and its adoption  of new ones.[4]</p>

          <h3>Window Engravings</h3>

          <p>The window engravings on the east and west entrances to the Stata
          Center are a direct contrast with every other building at MIT.
          Whereas the trend of painting or adding opaque lettering had pervaded
          the campus, the engraving of the glass reflects the sense of the
          <em>Technical Manifesto of April</em> that emphasizes the
          <q>multiplication of visual images caused by retinal
          persistence.</q> [5]</p>

          <p>The engravings' transience is variable. Because they are a part
          of the substrate, they are inherently permanent, but their perception
          is perpetually variable. If pedestrians had come to expect the
          opacity of a decal or painted lettering, they would be greeted by the
          <q>new analogues of normal vision</q> that [5] describes.</p>

        <h2>resolution</h2>
        <div class="copy">

          <p>MIT attempts to resolve the inherent anachronisms that arise from
          futurism by constantly re-imaging itself. No part of campus, it would
          seem, is free from this trend. By actively rejecting older
          appearances in favor of newer ones, MIT risks alienating its
          community, so it retains aspects of its original design. To mark its
          progression and to eliminate the possibility of stagnancy, it
          refreshes these classic facades with potentially short-term decorum
          that echoes the futurism <em>du jour</em>.</p>

          <p>The short term solution ensures a consistency in imagery across
          the institute (with the exception of the buildings that temporarily
          surpass the institute's baseline futurisim). However, this solution
          seems to spell doom for every building at some point. That is, there
          will come a time and place when the new futurism will surpass even
          the chaotic appearance of the Stata Center. When this time arrives,
          it seems that even the best laid attempts to reject the futurism of
          days past will still render the signage at the mighty Stata Center
          needing improvement.</p>
