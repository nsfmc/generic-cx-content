          <p>My name is Marcos Andres Ojeda. I was born on 21 Jun, 1983 in San
          Diego, CA. This makes me, depending on who you ask, a gemini/cancer
          mutt.</p>

          <p>I first started coding in html when i was knee-high to a tadpole,
          which was sometime around 1995 or 1996. One of my earliest computer
          related memories was going to a computer showroom when i must have
          been five or six years old and seeing a color apple computer. On the
          screen there was an 8-bit image of a golf course. Even back then, i
          was a real nerd. </p>

          <p>The picture to the left was taken by a good friend of mine. Her
          name is Jacqueline Yen. She graduated in 2004 and takes amazing
          photos. It was her and my friend Mike Pihulic that got me started
          doing yearbook related things.</p>
          
          <p>Even though i look twelve in the photo, i assure you, i was at
          least 20 years old when it was taken. At the time, i was nursing a
          mint plant back to life. My attempts all failed and the plant died. I
          was later told by someone that it's nearly impossible to kill a weed
          like mint.</p> 
          
          <p>Boy was she wrong.</p>
