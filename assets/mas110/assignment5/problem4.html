          <p>When i started this class I had coding experience but i had no
          idea what i wanted to do with design. The <a
          href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~maeda/mas110/ps1top.php?group=thinker"
          target="_opener">first assignment</a> probably shows this very clearly.
          I stole my own layout for the web pages because it was the nicest
          thing i had. I suppose to some degree, i was focused on trying to
          create clever things. I used this design to try to focus on the
          content, that is, i hoped that the content would be the most
          important thing, not the look of it.</p>

      <div class="subhead">
        <h2>middle</h2>

        <div class="copy">

          <p>By the time the <a
          href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~maeda/mas110/ps2top.php?group=thinker&prob=problem4.php"
          target="_opener">second</a> and <a
          href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~maeda/mas110/ps3top.php?group=thinker&prob=problem1.html" target="_opener">third
          assignments</a> had rolled around, i had focused exclusively on
          content. By reusing the visual aesthetic, i allowed people to get
          drawn into the message, the intimacy created by the website.</p>

          <p>That theme was elevated, that is, i wanted to make the anonymous
          web less anonymous. Content was everything, i decided. I worked
          really hard to try to figure out why it is that we can dissociate
          ourselves from some content, but not others. Some things have
          meaning, some things are important and some things only have meaning
          in context and others become only meaningful or important once that
          context is changed, perhaps even distorted.</p>

          <p>By focusing on content, i didn't design at all, except to isolate
          the content as much as possible, to focus it, to give meaning to
          it.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subhead">
        <h2>end</h2>

        <div class="copy">

          <p>The end, at least this end, is different. I am trying to
          anti-design even more. I want to focus on the content in its most
          pure and disgusting form. I have hoped by doing this, by
          transitioning in an almost backwards way, to detach meaning from
          aesthetic. To make, in some way, a message which exists beyond the
          visual space that it occupies.</p>
          
          <p>I have matured in my ability to draw and design in a way that
          echoes what i want to say. I feel like i have transitioned in my
          ability to understand how content affects a design, how a design may
          be irrelevant if its content refutes that aesthetic. I had not
          thought about that before, although i had wondered about it.</p>
          
          <p>I believe that technically, i have made small changes, i am less
          focused on clean code because the code is never seen. I am less
          focused on using complex code, because important things can happen
          without complexity. I am focused on understanding <em>the why</em> of
          what i do and how i can improve that. I feel that i am not a good
          artist, but i feel that i have a better concept of how to realize
          what i see in my head.</p>
