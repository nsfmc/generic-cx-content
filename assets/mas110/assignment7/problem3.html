          <p>I believe that this class is about getting to know someone by
          seeing what they do. What does someone think of themselves, look at
          how they introduce themselves or how they draw themselves. What does
          someone think of counting? ask them to count to one hundred.</p>
          
          <p>I created this portrait after realizing that it was almost
          impossible to draw using GD. Instead of trying to draw myself as a
          stick figure, which was my first instinct, i tried to draw the
          closest thing that would look 'sort of' like me. I blurred my
          eyes and started on the easiest shape i saw.</p>

          <p>I had hoped that i could apply a very strong GD gaussian filter so
          that the image might melt together and average out all its most
          jagged aspects, leaving you with what i saw while i was tracing out
          the image.</p>

          <p>As with other parts of this class, this portrait shows off a
          different side of me. It's as much of an introduction as drawing a triangle
          or counting to 100. It's me trying to draw the simplest shapes that
          kind of look like me. </p>
