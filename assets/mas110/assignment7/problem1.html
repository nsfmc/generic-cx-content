          <p>There are triangles everywhere. Quick! Pick three things you like,
          you've got a triangle! Pick a line and a point, it's a triangle! Find
          three freckles on someone's face and you've got another one.  There
          are triangles everywhere.</p>
          
          <p>I was walking around my apartment when I looked at the door and
          saw our temporary parking permit dangling on the door, suspended by a
          magnet.  Inside the large four, I saw clear as day a triangle.
          Granted, the four had a triangular shape, but so did the inside.</p>

          <p>The three lines of the number four frame a triangle with a kind of
          intentional precision. Imagine taking a spoon and a knife and fork
          and making a triangle out of them. The effect is the same, except
          with the four the side-effect is the appearance of a number instead
          of three utensils. Quick, look at that seven over there. I think it's
          hiding something...</p>
