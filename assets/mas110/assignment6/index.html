        <p>There are three critiques here. Lihua Bai's, Patricia Lubwama's and Nina Kim's.</p>

        <div class="copy">

          <p>Lihua's problem 1 presents a series of triangles that evoke depth
          yet present little more than color. The development is subtle, but it
          is consistent with Lihua's prior work. While in Assignment One, the
          emphasis was on a triangle that appeared to have depth, Assignment
          Three evolved to a series of pyramids with actual depth. In contrast
          Assignment Five forces the viewer to an overhead perspective. Now the
          observer looks down at a series of triangles on a sheet of white
          paper.  </p>

          <p>At once, the illusion is of transparency - two rectangles overlaid
          create a third color, except there is a fourth color. The deep red
          cannot be part of the skew rectangle, so the viewer is left wondering
          about what the illusion is. Lihua has taken a concept of dimension
          and superficially stripped her final piece of it. Instead of using
          geometry to imply dimension, she has used color to suggest depth and
          its dynamic nature.</p>

        <h2>patricia</h2>
        <img src="patti1.png" />

        <div class="copy">

          <p>Patti's problem two is colorful, overwhelming and honest. Above
          all, Patricia has always been straightforward and she has always
          presented to her viewer everything. Patti's exposure, however, lies
          beyond all the exclamation marks that she writes to us.</p>

          <p>Patricia's outward enthusiasm is refreshing and creates an
          assertive tone in each of her Assignments. In her Assignment One, she
          presented a cheerful and enthusiastic introduction that was
          punctuated by honesty, modesty and apology. In Assignment Three, she
          speaks to the viewer with the same candor that she introduced herself
          with. In Assignment Five, Patti tells us relatively little, but she
          still retains the same tone. We might think she was joking about
          being "Under the MIT dagger" until we see the final sentence, "Will
          she make it?"</p>

          <p>In other instances, Patricia has been apologetic, but never weak.
          It is in this final moment that she exposes a true uncertainty.
          Major: undecided. Will She make it? It is those universal elements of
          truthfulness and uncertainty that we only share with our closest
          friends that Patricia has unearthed at each stage of her work. We are
          left knowing about her and how she feels -- something more complex
          than any simple introduction could attempt.</p>

        <h2>nina</h2>
        <img src="nina1.png" />
        <img src="nina2.png" />
        <div class="copy">

          <p>Nina Kim's progression is enigmatic. Her most recent introduction
          tells us little of herself but reveals a hopeful facet, "I will wake
          up and I will shine." This is a theme prominent in Nina's work. She
          has often been grounded in self doubt, but in Assignment Five, Nina
          asserts herself unabashedly -- "I am me." In her self-asessment, Kim
          believes that as she has progressed through the semester her designs
          may now appear bland despite her improved skill. In contrast, instead
          of using superfluous visual elements, Kim now focuses the user on her
          work which is overwhelmingly well structured and concise. </p>

          <p>One might accuse Nina of revealing less and less of herself but
          that would be ignoring her progression. Kim's work is a continual
          re-tuning and expression of her growing artistic confidence which is
          arguably more revealing than any two-sentence sound-bite. Kim's new
          unapologetic tone in problems two and three of Assignment Five
          express an assertion instead of a doubt. Within context, her
          statement is evidence of an evolution that makes her work so exciting
          to review.</p>
