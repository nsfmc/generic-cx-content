        <h2>nude</h2>
        <div class="copy">

          <p>Marcel Duchamp is perhaps best remembered in this class for his
          <em>Nude Descending Staircase (no. 2).</em> What struck me the most
          was how much this piece had affected this class. While writing this
          paper, I counted no less than 20 instances of things descending in
          true Duchampian cubist style. However striking, Duchamp's nude is
          only a subset of a larger portfolio intent on challenging the
          artistic community.</p>

          <p>Grounded in a world of presentational art, the community Duchamp
          was challenging expected to be able to <q>project meaning</q> [krauss
          81] on to most art. However, Duchamp's <em>readymades</em> thwarted
          the art community's attempts to do just that. Typically lacking
          anything beyond a signature, the readymade ushers in a new type of
          art that transcends his <em>Nude Descending a Staircase (no. 2)</em>
          in almost every way.</p>

          <p>Lihua's counting is an example of a readymade. Instead of making
          the problem accessible to the viewer, she has presented him with a
          calculator.  She invites him to touch it, use it, perhaps even count
          with it. While there is an easily formed connection to the calculator
          and the thesis of the assignment, the calculator does not literally
          answer the assignment.</p>

          <p>In their most literal sense, the readymades transferred generic
          objects from the realm of the mundane into the world of the artistic
          [krauss 72]. Such an example is Duchamp's <em>In Advance of a Broken
          Arm,</em>  a lone shovel. That Duchamp had the insight to do
          this is astounding in its own right, but does not explain the
          motivation present behind the readymades. </p>

          <p>In part, Duchamp selected pre-fabricated items because they lacked
          any of his own influence. No person would be able to say that the
          craftsmanship of the shovel in <em>Broken Arm</em> was influenced by
          Duchamp's prevailing artistic beliefs because it was not made by him
          at all. Duchamp's contributions to the piece are strictly external to
          the piece rendering the interpretation at a different level
          entirely.</p>

          <p>There is something very critical about the readymades. Their power
          is derived solely from the personal interaction that people have with
          them. Lihua's calculator can be powerful if we can relate to it and
          pretend to  understand its significance. Once we believe that we know
          how the calculator relates to the assignment, we have formed the
          final connection that makes it tangible and we feel that we
          understand it in a context. But then we are left wondering, as we
          might have when we first saw the calculator, <q>why <em>this</em>
          calculator?</q> There is no definite <em>raison</em> to the
          readymades except their presence. Banham notes</p>

            <blockquote> The subject-matter becomes, without any transformation
            or qualification, the object presented for the public to
            view&#8212;the shocking effect it had was less concerned with
            iconography... than with the elimination of too many stages of the
            tradition process: subject-artist-painting-public. [banham
            204]</blockquote>

          <p>That is, the readymades have a power to transcend their own
          aesthetic because they lack the influence of their presenter.
          Duchamp's contribution to the art is that he had the presence of mind
          to place it there, but the <q>transformation and qualification</q> is
          provided solely by the viewer. By choosing objects that are devoid of
          his own influence, Duchamp empowers the viewer, making him an active
          participant.</p>

        <div class="copy">

          <p> Alan Cohen presents his counting to 100 by random process. The
          page forcefully reloads and counts to 100, but non-sequentially. Alan
          has not only removed from the viewer control, but he has enforced a
          process on him. While Cohen is responsible for the process, he never
          directly affects the presentation that is viewed.</p>

          <p>Despite the fact that the viewer will see all 100 numbers
          (eventually), Cohen has removed himself from the means of
          presentation. The randomization is purely dependent on the viewer,
          but the piece remains. The viewer cannot assert that Cohen intended
          him to see a specific ordering of numbers, but Cohen can be assured
          that the viewer has been exposed to them. Cohen does not take
          responsibility for the details of the presentation but instead
          presents the material in a way that is devoid of its original
          context. The viewer must assert a reason behind the piece.</p>

          <p>Duchamp does more than empower the viewer, he co-opts him by
          making him responsible for understanding the reason and then
          motivation behind each piece. This motivation is not only subversive
          but it transcends even the radical nature of cubism and otherwise
          representational futurism.  Krauss notes that Duchamp </p>
          
            <blockquote>raise[s] questsions about what exactly is the nature of
            the work in the term <q>work of art</q>... a work might not be a
            physical object but rather a question, [krauss 73]</blockquote>

          <p>It is then, this subversion that gives power to his pieces. While
          Duchamp revels in the <q>opacity</q> of Raymond Roussel's mechanized
          production method [krauss 76], so he delights in the opacity of his
          own method.  Duchamp, speaking of Roussel says <q>What mattered, was
          an attitude, more than an influence, to know how he had done all that
          and why...</q> Duchamp has asserted his own attitudes via the
          readymades while destroying the concept of influence that he may have
          otherwise inserted in his own work. Duchamp's reasons may be known,
          but his influence is notably absent because </p>

            <blockquote>the work is deprived of its conventional source of
            meaning...the mechanization of the art act becomes a barrier to
            this conventional right of access.</blockquote>

        <img src="timan.gif" alt="optical illusion of obscurity" />
        <div class="copy">

          <p>Erik Fogg takes the role of Brancusi in his Duchampian counting.
          Fogg's subversion is more direct. He has told the viewer what to
          observe, even what elements he finds worth noting, but in the end,
          <q>it is a contemplation that is as unreceptive to analysis as the
          polished marble...</q> Indeed, we could observe one hundred or one
          thousand of these balls and arrive nowhere beyond where we were at
          the beginning. Fogg's exposition of this is by no means unique, Timan
          Goshit's problem number five offers the same obscurity. We are
          offered a Duchamp-style optical illusion one hundred times but each
          time we are left with the same result as if we had only seen one.
          </p>

          <p>Like Duchamp's readymades, Erik and Timan's works provide the
          illusion of cohesion on first glance. They appear to fulfill the
          requirement originally posed of them, but they frustrate the viewer
          because they do not provide a particularly tangible way to understand
          them. The viewer's analysis is thus turned to the essence of why he
          feels the pieces are worthy of attention, but this loop may be
          cyclical at best and at worst offer no more insight than that he
          initially possessed.</p>

          <p>The power that Duchamp wields is his obsession with <q>the
          question of what it is that makes a 'work' of art.</q> And indeed,
          that is part of the power that is evident in the works of the
          students in the class. Duchamp had the ability or perhaps audacity to
          disregard</p>

          <blockquote>the notion that there must be an intimate, casual
          connection between an individual and what he makes. [krauss
          71]</blockquote>
