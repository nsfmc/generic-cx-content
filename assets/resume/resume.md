![ios app][iosappscreen]

Visual design of web features along with frontend development and additional backend feature development. Although that sounds really vague, it basically means designing, implementing and servicing features from layout and design conception all the way to final execution across a python-based backend to a react-backed frontend.

Works on the development of frontend javascript libraries and [actively contributes patches upstream][githubprofile] to git-hosted open source projects as needed in the course of using third party libraries at Khan Academy.

Prototyped, designed and collaborated with engineers to develop the [Khan Academy iOS app][iosapp], its library structure, and its novel interface for interactive exercises and its inline video views.

Developed documentation and example programs in Swift for [Prototope](https://khan.github.io/Prototope), a swift/javascript framework for iOS application prototyping.

With Hoon Kim, grad.risd.edu was developed as a website for the graduate division developed for two audiences: students engaging in their own work and prospective students looking to discover more about graduate studies at risd.

For outward facing design, the site contained a minimized hierarchy of relevant documents and exploratory department listings as well as informational flash encoded video. For inward facing design, the site contained resources for thesis students such as web bookmark archival and sharing tools (similar to reddit), thesis status updates pulled via flickr feeds and other social media.
