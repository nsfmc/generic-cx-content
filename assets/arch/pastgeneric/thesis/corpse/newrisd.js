Since I am a believer in frugality and a focus on expenditures to benefit scholarships and academic passion, I am bringing my own office furniture to RISD (a few years ago Herman Miller gave me a bunch of things in a barter deal for speaking to their management) as well as a few items I personally purchased from MIT. The ever-strong <b>Denise Siomkin</b> is currently living among all the clutter of my old life in a tiny office space &#8212; I appreciate her perseverance.</p></div>",

Ms. Anderson&#8217;s remarks were inspiring, and there was an air of solemnity that was tempered by humor all around.  I want to make sure that a couple of people get recognized and thanked, though.  First and foremost is Blair De ST Croix and his whole Office of Student Life.  I have gotten to know Blair well, and he is works tirelessly to make things happen.  Herding all of those students would give me about thirty ulcers, but he was still smiling at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>And Cecile from the Office of Student Affairs was working hard as well, zooming around and keeping an eye on things.

Perhaps it was more than a sign when I found some chicks from my kindergartner&#8217;s school living with the family after I was away this week. New life. New opportunities to think anew. </p>\n<p>Like most of us here at RISD, many of us have a tiny bit of Bauhaus influence somewhere in our bones. I recall a book of Bauhaus quotes I once had (all my books are now donated to the RISD library or beyond) attributed to Apollinaire I believe that went like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<i>New man must have the courage to be new.</i>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note that this was uttered in the early 1900s so it all tickles your mind a bit as it remains a timeless phrase to consider. It was the artistic community&#8217;s reaction to the technology of the time (i.e. concrete, glass, steel) and also to the then tumultuous nature of the political and economic spheres (i.e. World War I, and later the Great Depression). In 2008 we face the same questions of technology (i.e. the &#8220;Adobe-izing&#8221; of all of arts/design) and government (i.e. our war in Iraq and our recessionary economy). </p>\n<p>Like in the time of the Bauhaus, and maybe more needed than ever given that our world is so incredibly interconnected that the metaphorical flap of a butterfly wing *does* lead to a hurricane on the other side of the earth at least in cyberspace, &#8230; one school needs to take the lead among all other schools and define the future of art and design. I hope and believe that school is our school. Our RISD. </p>\n<p>Dream anew and enjoy the nice day,<br/>\nJohn</p></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>Hello RISD,</p>\n<p>Part of the reason for this blog is to put the RISD rumor mill out of business. The rumor mill can do swimmingly well at other organizations, but at the new RISD we can begin to put it out to pasture hopefully. Rumors have a way of making what is good, bad; and what is bad, deadly. The way to dispel a rumor is to simply state the truth. Here are my two favorite rumors right now and the stories of truth that lie behind them:</p>\n<p><b>Rumor #1:</b> Many of you have seen the announcement of <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/email/garvin/index.html\">Beth Garvin</a> and some are wondering if John is consciously MIT-izing RISD. Nope. If I wanted that I would have stayed at MIT, right? Beth is someone that I actually never met at MIT before &#8212; MIT is a BIG place &#8212; and she was way top at MIT&#8217;s administration and I was just a professor. The first conversation I had with her was when she answered the ad for the position. My first reaction was, &#8220;Hmmmmm, I bet that the RISD rumor mill would misinterpret such a person coming to RISD&#8221; &#8230; so in all honesty I had decided to focus on other candidates in the big pile of RISD-hopefuls. And then I began to see her in comparison to the other candidates that wanted to become RISD-ized, looked at her as someone that could have come from Harvard or another school to be fully objective, and I knew that of the remaining candidates Beth was the one that stood above the rest in terms of development experience, passion for RISD&#8217;s educational mission, and a sense of humor. </p>\n<p>In my conversations with Beth it has become clear that she is like <i>me</i> and all of <i>you</i> &#8212; wanting to creatively connect with students, faculty, and alums in brand new ways. She wants to be a part of this grand social experiment that I am bringing to my new RISD family: <i>to realize an academic institution the way it was meant to be by being fully connected with its educational mission and passionate constituents.</i> I feel so happy to welcome this newly found friend to our community &#8230; and by the excitement currently generating in the Institutional Engagement office right now for what she brings to the table in terms of leadership acumen and creative sensibilities &#8212; a new door has opened for RISD for engaging its fans and supporters. Get excited RISD!</p>\n<p><b>Rumor #2:</b> There is a rumor that Academic Affairs is moving to Provwash sometime in the near future. It is true that it is currently being evaluated. But no decision has been made yet. If you&#8217;d like to ask or comment <i>why?</i> please do join the conversation. One important reason for RISD&#8217;s future is that by doing so it would help to reduce the psychological divide so evident here between &#8220;academics&#8221; and &#8220;administration.&#8221; Every single living person at RISD is a RISD person working on the educational mission. I believe we have an opportunity in the next few years to enter a desegregation and unifying process where we can all feel less encapsulated within our smaller groups and instead begin to embrace <i>one</i> RISD. There may be the Balls and the Nads but there&#8217;s really only one team here &#8230; RISD.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I am a big believer in Mayor Bloomberg of New York&#8217;s style of a resource hungry-less leader &#8212; read <a href=\"http://governing.typepad.com/13thfloor/2007/02/warming_up_in_t.html\">this story</a> to learn more about him. Bloomberg is a neat example of a leader for this new century. Frankly, I have humble and meager needs and you will see those values enacted in the coming years. And office-wise I am working with Denise to shrink the President&#8217;s Office&#8217;s footprint to be more in line with what the 21st century demands. This blog you see here is my open office. Come inside. Welcome to the many conversations we will have together!</p>\n<p>Best Regards,<br/>\nJohn</p></div>",

And I am intent to keep RISD the way it is &#8212; a unique system of creativity oozing out of every part of itself. Cherishing the traditions of the ages, while fearlessly engaging in experimentation in the name of the arts. And amidst it all, having an incredibly great time doing what is right for humanity. There could be no other place in the world that people flock to find the truth in human expression.</p>\n<p>Part of keeping the line of truth is to find ways to increase RISD&#8217;s attractiveness to corporate support, while ensuring that RISD <em>absolutely</em> does not sell itself out. We can do this by keeping true to RISD always. <em>Becky Bermont,</em> the new head of the Media+Partners unit formed out of existing Communications+Design division with an added dose of special seasoning, is intent with me on finding ways to interact with outside supporters and staying true to RISD. RISD cannot be reduced to being analogous to a business &#8212; as Prof. <strong>Kyna Leski</strong> importantly <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/30/student-professor-experiences/#comment-328\">points out</a>. If Google has the phrase, &#8220;Do no evil.&#8221; Then RISD deserves the phrase, &#8220;Never sell out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Becky is currently aligning our strategy for partnerships around a simple idea, &#8220;We are a school, and we will act like one.&#8221; We are *not* a business. Our goal is to train some of the best minds in the world that will transcend the norm of industry and create brand new industries and expressions for the world. To do so, we must remain true to the simple fact that <em>we are a school.</em> Secondly, we engage with the outside not for profit motivations, but to expand our global reputation. Partnerships connect us with the greater world and lets RISD be seen in a new light. Consider the incredible collaboration with the ITC by the <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/ngallery/albums/117.aspx\">Textiles and Apparel Depts</a> (ed: see also <em><a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/sponsored_research_itc.htm\" title=\"RISD + ITC\">here</a></em>). The world quickly took note. Many departments engage with outside entities and the world benefits from experiencing the unique RISD perspective. Partnerships get our name out there, and we want to be *very* picky about whom we partner with.</p>\n<p>To summarize, RISD is RISD. People really like and love RISD already. Moving forward the goal is to make them love RISD <em>even more</em>.</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Even though RISD is not a business&#8230;of course it is good to have a consciousness about business&#8230;as part of the world that the students will graduate into. This is especially true given the evolving &#8220;deliverables&#8221; of creativity from physical things to digital ones. Great article on this topic, in today&#8217;s NYTimes:</p>\n<p>Bits, Bands and Books By PAUL KRUGMAN<br/>\nPublished: June 6, 2008</p>\n<p>Do you remember what it was like back in the old days when we had a New Economy? In the 1990s, jobs were abundant, oil was cheap and information technology was about to change everything.</p>\n<p>Then the technology bubble popped. Many highly touted New Economy companies, it turned out, were better at promoting their images than at making money &#8212; although some of them did pioneer new forms of accounting fraud. After that came the oil shock and the food shock, grim reminders that we&#8217;re still living in a material world.</p>\n<p>So much, then, for the digital revolution? Not so fast. The predictions of &#8217;90s technology gurus are coming true more slowly than enthusiasts expected &#8212; but the future they envisioned is still on the march.</p>\n<p>In 1994, one of those gurus, Esther Dyson, made a striking prediction: that the ease with which digital content can be copied and disseminated would eventually force businesses to sell the results of creative activity cheaply, or even give it away. Whatever the product &#8212; software, books, music, movies &#8212; the cost of creation would have to be recouped indirectly: businesses would have to &#8220;distribute intellectual property free in order to sell services and relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, she described how some software companies gave their product away but earned fees for installation and servicing. But her most compelling illustration of how you can make money by giving stuff away was that of the Grateful Dead, who encouraged people to tape live performances because &#8220;enough of the people who copy and listen to Grateful Dead tapes end up paying for hats, T-shirts and performance tickets. In the new era, the ancillary market is the market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Indeed, it turns out that the Dead were business pioneers. Rolling Stone recently published an article titled &#8220;Rock&#8217;s New Economy: Making Money When CDs Don&#8217;t Sell.&#8221; Downloads are steadily undermining record sales &#8212; but today&#8217;s rock bands, the magazine reports, are finding other sources of income. Even if record sales are modest, bands can convert airplay and YouTube views into financial success indirectly, making money through &#8220;publishing, touring, merchandising and licensing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What other creative activities will become mainly ways to promote side businesses? How about writing books?</p>\n<p>According to a report in The Times, the buzz at this year&#8217;s BookExpo America was all about electronic books. Now, e-books have been the coming, but somehow not yet arrived, thing for a very long time. (There&#8217;s an old Brazilian joke: &#8220;Brazil is the country of the future &#8212; and always will be.&#8221; E-books have been like that.) But we may finally have reached the point at which e-books are about to become a widely used alternative to paper and ink.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly my impression after a couple of months&#8217; experience with the device feeding the buzz, the Amazon Kindle. Basically, the Kindle&#8217;s lightness and reflective display mean that it offers a reading experience almost comparable to that of reading a traditional book. This leaves the user free to appreciate the convenience factor: the Kindle can store the text of many books, and when you order a new book, it&#8217;s literally in your hands within a couple of minutes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good enough package that my guess is that digital readers will soon become common, perhaps even the usual way we read books.</p>\n<p>How will this affect the publishing business? Right now, publishers make as much from a Kindle download as they do from the sale of a physical book. But the experience of the music industry suggests that this won&#8217;t last: once digital downloads of books become standard, it will be hard for publishers to keep charging traditional prices.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if e-books become the norm, the publishing industry as we know it may wither away. Books may end up serving mainly as promotional material for authors&#8217; other activities, such as live readings with paid admission. Well, if it was good enough for Charles Dickens, I guess it&#8217;s good enough for me.</p>\n<p>Now, the strategy of giving intellectual property away so that people will buy your paraphernalia won&#8217;t work equally well for everything. To take the obvious, painful example: news organizations, very much including this one, have spent years trying to turn large online readership into an adequately paying proposition, with limited success.</p>\n<p>But they&#8217;ll have to find a way. Bit by bit, everything that can be digitized will be digitized, making intellectual property ever easier to copy and ever harder to sell for more than a nominal price. And we&#8217;ll have to find business and economic models that take this reality into account.</p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t all happen immediately. But in the long run, we are all the Grateful Dead.\n</p><p/></div>",

As we went around the room finding out each other&#8217;s names and backgrounds, this forty something year old gave his name and said that he was the director of design education in Korea (this was some kind of government post&#8230;don&#8217;t have his business card in front of me). He was here doing some kind of research/fellowship project on teaching in I.D. and he  somehow was directed to my class and wanted to sit in. He did sit in&#8230;every Tuesday and Thursday from 9:40 a.m. to 5:40 p.m. for 13 weeks. He followed me around the studio on desk crits, pin-ups and documented what he saw with a camera.

(The Society for Film and Media Studies created a statement on copyright in 2007 that has been widely debated, as well). </p>\n<p>It would be great to have Lawrence Lessig come to RISD and talk about the Creative Commons movement; I would also recommend some of the others who have been involved in the public discussions over copyright in recent years: Siva Vaidhyanathan, Kembrew McLeod, Jessica Litman, etc. Marc Perlman, in the Music Department at Brown, has also done a lot of sound thinking about copyright issues, particularly as they pertain to the arts. I teach a section on intellectual property every year in my American Politics and Public Debate course, and&#8212;I hope he won&#8217;t mind me saying this&#8211;for the past several years, RISD&#8217;s General Counsel, Steve McDonald, has given a wonderfully engaging presentation to my students on the legal issues around music downloading. </p>\n<p>I am not volunteering to set up a symposium, but it might be good to create some curricular energy around issues of creativity and intellectual property within the RISD community. Intellectual property is central to outside partnerships, of course.

Having been very fortunate to be involved in more than a few partnerships while here at risd, I wanted to follow on some of the earlier comments and add a few thoughts of my own. </p>\n<p>Sheila says, &#8220;if we take care of our pedagogical jobs our reputation will take care of itself.&#8221; This is a good point that highlights the role of the alumni in forming and disseminating risd&#8217;s reputation. They&#8217;re really risd&#8217;s ambassadors. What the students do after they leave risd is what will ultimately define the risd reputation and has more lasting value than what&#8217;s happening at given moment here at risd. If we&#8217;ve all done our jobs and helped them become the best, most creative thinkers they can be, their reputations will build the risd reputation. Of course it never hurts to make sure that those connections are clear and that what&#8217;s happening at risd is visible.  And although our reputation is important, I see it primarily as a means to an end - creating  a global risd impact equal or greater than it&#8217;s global reputation. </p>\n<p>I too am interested in Chris Anderson&#8217;s thoughts, particularly on the less &#8220;digital&#8221; world. One of risd&#8217;s real strengths is the integration of the physical into the conceptual thought processes. Engaging both hemispheres is better than either one alone. And, although not equally relevant to all work done here or by our alumni, the physical (less &#8220;digital&#8221;) side of IP goes beyond copyright or CC, to include patents. In the work done with partners at risd, this can often be an issue and has its own significant challenges.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really good to see Truth 1 list pedagogical goals so significantly. I don&#8217;t want to see risd sell out (or do evil even though that phrase has been taken already) and it&#8217;s important to keep our objectives clear. Engaging outside partners doesn&#8217;t require selling out. Another pedagogical goal that&#8217;s easy to overlook extends beyond our student to include educating our partners as well. The ones that approach risd may have some sense of why they want to engage with us, but their impressions shouldn&#8217;t limit us. We need to help them understand what risd and its alumni can do for them as well as the rest of the world. But we also need to reach out to those who might not even think of engaging with risd, to educate them as well. that will only help risd strengthen its impact. We&#8217;ve done fairly well with the first group, but we can do better than we have with the partners that don&#8217;t even know they need us yet.\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;ve noted that most strangers also cannot spell RISD :  RDSI, RSID, RSDI. Note that I absolutely have no intention of suggesting we change our name. We just have to strengthen for the public to teach them how to spell it, and also what we mean by &#8220;our RISD&#8221; in a clear, resonant mantra. As for the dream website where your relatives can finally vouch for your professorial stature at RISD, we will get there. I see the green-tinged clouds out yonder.

I have been fortunate enough, as a so-called &#8220;Power-User&#8221; of the Intranet to take part in some of the planning/testing for the upcoming overhaul. </p>\n<p>Speaking as an observer (and not part of the team that actually builds/maintains this infrastructure) I&#8217;d say that over the years RISDs web presence (both internal and external) has been built ad hoc as time, resources, staffing, funds, infrastructure, needs&#8230; allow. It is my understanding that Lisa Segura handcoded much (or all) of the current intranet system herself for instance, which is no small task. </p>\n<p>What I see from being part of the re-building process over the last year, before and after John came on board as President bringing his unique vision to the table, is that the Communications + Design team is working hard to ensure that we have a strong technology and software base upon which to build the future of RISDs web presence. The new system will give great power and flexibility for all RISDoids to contribute to and build RISDs web presence. </p>\n<p>My understanding is that originally, the goal was to get the external sites rebuilt first, but it was decided that the Intranet, as a tool that is vital to the operation of the school and is used everyday by all of us on campus, was really very important. So that would be where John&#8217;s 1-2 year timeline is coming from. I think that 2 year is when it will be all shiny and something that we can all be proud of. Of course it will continue to be built upon and expanded infinitely beyond that time period. And there are deadlines within that two year timetable for various facets of the system to go live. </p>\n<p>I would encourage you to contact Lisa Segura and see if you can sit in on one of the upcoming meetings where further planning will be discussed and the actual implementation will start. </p>\n<p>Jef<br/>\nPublic Safety\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Mairead, </p>\n<p>The matter of putting content like video and audio onto the web is a simple task of drag/drop the data and voila we&#8217;re live. So there isn&#8217;t much website design that needs to get done in that case of moving an archive off of files and onto the Web. As for the process of building a true website that can process all the needed pages and data to support something that looks more like a unified presence <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">like this</a>, the reality is that there are few university/college websites where there is a unified format. It begs the question of &#8220;what is the best way to present the variety of aspects of RISD?&#8221; Most university/colleges take you into subsites for each department. The upside of this is that each department has a unique flavor; the downside of this is that they don&#8217;t all look as though they are unified under one flag. If you take the 16 art/design departments + 3 liberal arts components + 3 varieties of foundation studies, the question of designing 22 different microsites versus creating one single uberpresence is a general question of what the design philosophy should be, and then one of sheer manpower to get that going. </p>\n<p>And in the same way I am inheriting the Chace that is being completed in the fall, I am also inheriting activity that has focused on RISD&#8217;s intranet as Jef points out. There is a virtual &#8220;building&#8221; being built that has to run to completion which I estimate is still a year out. Manpower cannot divert from that while it gets put in place. It will also help RISD realize a way to at least centralize some of its content and start building from there.</p>\n<p>However &#8230; I am looking for faster ways in which we can at least do a makeshift fix to our front page and also address what I feel is important &#8212; which is at least show our combined might to the world. And we&#8217;ll get there. Whether in 2010, 2009, or 2008. A truly ideal solution will take at least 2 years. I&#8217;m looking now for a Macgyver-ish solution that can hit us in 2008 as I am in sync with you. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://art.yale.edu/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yale U School of Art</a> has the best example of a truly &#8220;sustainable website&#8221; out there. It&#8217;s a completely WIKI-based website that *anyone* in the homepage can edit (even the home page). It was designed by one of my former students and at one time I specced whether it were adaptable to RISD, however RISD is at a larger scale than that school so might not work as well. What it does show is that content that is generated by the actual people (i.e. the users) is always fresh and relevant. The core theme is that when you decentralize the design/support of a website, the content is always great. WIKIpedia is the best example of this phenomenon &#8212; when everyone participates, the data becomes meaningful.</p>\n<p>On the other hand consider this website <a href=\"http://ist.psu.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> &#8212; it uses a very simple template. Photograph, name, academic pedigree, and short bio. This kind of system is not difficult to build &#8212; it indeed can be built in a day. BUT the process of collecting all the photos and bios and so forth &#8212; that is the fundamental challenge in that case. That requires a &#8220;content management system&#8221; &#8212; which is what the group that Jef points out is now building. That is still at least a year out to finishing its instatement. </p>\n<p>But who knows. Magic may happen sooner than you think &#8230; I like magic.</p>\n<p>Cheers, John\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;m still not 100% clear on what makes RISD different that almost any other educational institution in respect to including academic program &amp; faculty as a basic component of the website.  I&#8217;m gleaning that it&#8217;s that no resources in terms of personnel have ever been devoted to this?  Am I right?  I hear what Eric is saying and think that faculty will step up.  I haven&#8217;t done a web page myself because I have been anticipating change that would make it redundant.  I may not be understanding this right but I am seeing 3 stages relating to this question, over the last 6 years I&#8217;ve been here: Stage 1: no investment of resources in publicizing academic program &amp; faculty, a strategy which left RISD faculty &amp; staff outside common protocol; Stage 2 (the last year or two maybe): some faculty &amp; staff biographies available in drop-down menus at <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.risd.edu</a>, and a gradual move toward facilitating faculty profiles on the Intranet, prompted by the Dean of Liberal Arts; Stage 3: a really wonderful delineation of the academic program, etc, much better than the basic norm (the step we&#8217;re skipping), promised for 2009/2010.  The picture I&#8217;m building (I&#8217;m slow) is that Eric, Lisa, Liz O&#8217;Neil, Liz L, have done a sterling job in a ludicrously under-resourced situation in which the representation of the academic program was not a priority.  Is this correct?  I know, from the point of view of a faculty member, it has just felt really strange &amp; unexpected that the academic program has never been articulated in a basic way on the web.  Maybe we (the faculty) have been too engrossed in the demands of the pedagogical mission to even think of seeing ourselves from the outside.  Maybe I&#8217;m just engaged in an autopsy here anyway, as things are now changing wonderfully and it&#8217;s obvious what marvelous team-work is responsible.

When I was at Art Center giving <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/08/the-risd-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a talk</a> and when was asked what my funding priorities were at RISD I said, &#8220;scholarships and academic excellence (passion)&#8221; the crowd broke into a spontaneous applause.

If RISD, as an academic institution, truly wants to promote its faculty, then someone has got to be in charge of going around to the departments, getting photos, gleaning information, and putting the presentation together. (As Mairead noted earlier, at other institutions, taking a photo and getting a bio information for the web is a standard procedure for new faculty when they arrive on campus). If no one&#8217;s guiding the cultural change, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen. Doing a webpage&#8211;which can be perceived as a vanity project rather than an institutional imperative&#8211;very quickly can get pushed to the side, especially during the insanity of the semester at RISD and especially when it is framed as yet another &#8220;do-it-yourself&#8221; project from the technology side of the College. (To be fair, the &#8220;you need to work that out yourself&#8221; approach to technology was, in my experience, far more pervasive under the old CNS rather than the new OIT). </p>\n<p>Overall, I am very appreciative of the time Lisa put into the temporary faculty web pages on the Intranet; she has been stellar in her responsiveness and professionalism. This is not at all about individuals at OIT&#8211;it&#8217;s about the values that have informed policy decisions over the past ten years and the flow of resources according to those values. I still find it hard to fathom that an academic institution of RISD&#8217;s caliber did not pull out the stops to fully feature its academic programs, achievements, and talent online years ago. Along with the other ongoing problems with technology at RISD, there&#8217;s damage done there, and it&#8217;s going to take time for some of us to get over the feelings of frustration and exhaustion. I will follow John&#8217;s advice, though, stop complaining, and look forward to what&#8217;s next.\n</p><p/></div>",

When Eric says, &#8220;While I am encouraged by the 12 who used the system - I have to evaluate the time spent on programming a user-specific self-submitting web publishing project vs. other initiatives that will benefit the institution overall,&#8221; he does imply that a clear presentation of the academic program serves the faculty only and not the institution as a whole.  This is clearly a mistake.</p>\n<p>On self-submission, I can think of a few reasons why it&#8217;s not happening more quickly.  First, younger faculty are not tuned in to a do-it-yourself approach to institutional web page making.  As Dan says, the standard practice at educational institutions is that material is gathered by the institution and added to the existing site.  Second, older faculty are more embedded in the institution, and less likely to see the needs of those looking at it, including students, especially with regard to newish technology.  Thirdly, there is a level of despair among the faculty over this issue.</p>\n<p>When Ann Fessler approached me about it, when I was on the Presidential Search Committee last year, we got together a small group of faculty to press for change, but then discovered Barbara Von Eckardt, and Dan, and others in Liberal Arts had already made some headway, so we fell back.  I thought then, and I still think, that a very low tech approach would also be helpful.  At that time, I was willing to go, one-by-one, to faculty, and gather the information.  I was thinking of it as a story-gathering, community-building project too.  With Dan, I firmly believe that there should be a person dedicated to this job, i.e., once the very accessible web structure is in place, to gathering and facilitating the presentation of the information about all faculty and staff.  Even if it is slow, the fact that developing the network of information is also systematic and somewhat inexorable will be comforting.  It could possibly be a rich experience for all, sort of a living archive, if a person could be dedicated to this task.</p>\n<p>Thanks all for the gigabyte! Roll on June 16!\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I think what is being asked is why is RISD not remotely up to speed with other colleges in terms of having a functional website including the academic program.  Art Center may be on the same page with us on the scholarships &amp; academic excellence front but, er, Art Center already has a functional website <a href=\"http://www.artcenter.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.artcenter.edu/</a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s such a relief to see Dan&#8217;s posts as he clearly takes for granted a basic information system which at RISD is inexplicable.  For example, the direct links on our front page are:</p>\n<p>About RISD<br/>\nAlumni<br/>\nAdmissions<br/>\nDegree Programs<br/>\nParents<br/>\nGive to RISD<br/>\nContinuing Ed<br/>\nMuseum</p>\n<p>This is an unusual configuration, to say the least.   In conversations on this blog, the educational mission of the school has been emphasized; likewise in our mission statement.  But the educational mission of the school is de-emphasized on the website.  The information about the academic program is not prominent and it&#8217;s incomplete.</p>\n<p>This is not the place other schools are starting from.  So I&#8217;m confused by your Art Center example, John.  I think faculty in the Division of Liberal Arts probably are more likely to expect good web articulation of programs because that&#8217;s the current culture of universities.  But schools of art &amp; design too see the value of a website as a portal for information about the academic program.  You yourself have pointed to Yale School of Art as a model <a href=\"http://art.yale.edu/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://art.yale.edu/Home</a></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s SCAD whom we&#8217;re going to scad: <a href=\"http://www.scad.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scad.edu/</a></p>\n<p>The weird thing about this discussion is the level of persuasion that seems necessary, or the level of misunderstanding.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a relief to see Dan&#8217;s post, and I know Barbara, as Dean of Liberal Arts, and Sandy, as Interim Dean, are more or less on the same page.</p>\n<p>I can see great changes already, since we installed our new Microchip, so I don&#8217;t want to be negative.  I have great faith that the scene is changing as we speak, and I can see it.<br/>\nBut please, no suggestions that a clear web delineation of the academic program is not<br/>\ncentral, or that faculty webpages are vain/careerist, or that faculty themselves are remiss is not getting their acts together more quickly since January.</p>\n<p>Becky said, earlier, let&#8217;s talk.  I&#8217;d be glad of any opportunity to do that rather than continue here, because there is a limit to good interpersonal/professional communication on a blog.  I would like to email Becky but can&#8217;t find an address or phone number for her on the website or Intranet.</p>\n<p>Mairead\n</p><p/></div>",

It uses a WIKI and is fully participatory. </p>\n<p>HI Mairead, My point on the Art Center example was that their focus has been primarily on new building projects and yes on top of that they also had a website in place. RISD historically moved first on the building projects on campus and less on the web. It is clear that there was great desire by almost everybody imaginable to move on the Web but there was no leadership in place that cared about this Web stuff as deeply as I do. Everyone working on the RISD web stuff is brand new and part of an incremental phase-in that was put in place lovingly by LizO over the past couple years to get RISD moving. </p>\n<p>Soooo, in short. RISD&#8217;s buildings are almost done being built (Chace opens in September). And I have absolutely no interest in building new buildings. Lots of behind-the-scenes construction is happening led by a bighearted team of folks on the tiny Web team so that RISD can have a website that every single person here (and beyond) can be proud of. Yes, the semantics of the front page and so forth will change with time. And yes the educational mission of RISD is the single core of what all of us do here, and the Web will reflect that in no uncertain terms.</p>\n<p>Thank you, John\n</p><p/></div>",

Jef, thanks for talking about the specturm of RISDoids who relate to &#8216;technology&#8217; of which the (admittedly deficient but improving rapidly) web page is just one part.  I do not think it is fear that makes some of us slower than others.  Yes, I have to put myself on the slow end of the spectrum.  I was born before color TV and listened to radio soap operas with my gran.  Despite what my children think I can program an I pod and use a Blackberry - when I chose to.  To have had the almost surreal privilege of going from tube based radios to 24/7 internet has been an exhilarating ride for me/us.  My professional life started with typewriters and we learned Morse Code in school.  I would say my generation of users is characterized by being excited by technology, not being afraid of it at all.  Also not taking it for granted. And I believe we have a unique perspective on the balance of technology&#8217;s possibilities and its limitations.  Because we have seen so much more radical change in such a short time than some who come after us I think this perspective is important.  In my case I am always looking for the things that endure regardless of the technology.  In other words, so much change, such dramatic change, such quick change - yes!  But what is it that has NOT changed?  I think of this in a practical way as what are the Core Skills that I still have to impart to my children (like John teaching his daughter to drive by keeping her eyes on the road).  What has not changed, despite or maybe because of the technology is that we still need to learn the basic skills of relationships and those skills are in the realm of face to face communications.  Another way of saying this is if we do not have face to face correct then we do not have the basis on which to design the web based communications.  If I can take this further there are ways in which we RISDoids can improve on our human relationship skills while we are developing our technological relationship skills.  Wait, am I in the wrong post for this conversation?\n</p><p/></div>",

BEB, etc. However, I will always attempt to help in this regard. The hardest part will be when three classes are standing in line at one time at the begining of each semester.

Within the 10 years I have been at the store I have seen it evolve greatly. The store is called a supply store or a hardware store but it is much more. We are another support system for students, artist, or anyone to complete a goal or project.  Besides the physical items in the store there exists an environment of sharing and learning. The word instruction is in our name and that is what we do. I answer countless questions everyday.  I have learned a lot from instructors, techs, staff, and students in my time here at RISD and continue to learn. I try to use that knowledge and experience to make this store as successful as possible.<br/>\n\tThe store has been hidden away in the basement of the Metcalf building since its beginning. I have always said it is RISD&#8217;s best kept secret. The construction of the Chase center emphasized a problem we have which is accessibility. This past year has been difficult to say the least. The construction is coming to an end and a new problem has arisen. The building is on card access only. I know many will say that only RISD students shop there anyway. That is not the case. We supply other local colleges as well as the art community locally and beyond. The chance to bring the store out to the world is very exciting. Now when people talk about the little supply store that has the coolest stuff they will be able to find us.<br/>\n\tThe new location is slightly smaller which means some reorganization and condensing must be done.

Of course that is important but, and perhaps I have been here too long, I&#8217;d like to start a thread on what RISD should be careful not to lose. I&#8217;ve been at RISD since 1988 and it has been more than a home to me. I started as a figure model, became a student, a teaching assistant, a Pre-College teacher, a prospective parent of a RISD student; currently I am a parent of a RISD student and will within one year will be the parent of a RISD alum. Now I am a RISD alum and staff person who has worked in Continuing Ed, Fine Arts, and Academic Affairs. I think that I can safely say that I have had a total and complete RISD education.</p>\n<p>What don&#8217;t I want to lose at RISD? First and foremost I want to be certain that we hold on to the easy camaraderie the staff share as fellow workers in a highly intellectual and competitive community. The stress is high for all of us, but as long as we feel that we are an integral part of bringing RISD&#8217;s magic forward for all to experience, the rewards are even higher.</p>\n<p>I also don&#8217;t want to lose the physical part of RISD, as I really appreciate the odd collection of RISD buildings, most of which were created for one function but changed, quite often in strange ways, as RISD&#8217;s ingenious faculty and staff figured out how to make them work. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in danger of this, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to see a corporate sponsor arrive who wants to help move us to newer and better functioning buildings. Also, I love being in Providence, a small but very vibrant city that is so easy to get around in.

As we stand at the beginning of a new RISD era, it&#8217;s all the more important to reflect upon where we have been and what we do/should cherish.  Unlike Alice&#8217;s multi-faceted experiences at RISD, my experience has been one-dimensional, that of a faculty member, but my professional career began and stayed with RISD, just like Jay Coogan&#8217;s.  </p>\n<p>I agree with Alice that what I don&#8217;t want us to lose is the sense of camaraderie and support/respect for each other.  Those of us who weathered the ups and downs over the years have a strong sense of bond and shared experiences.  This does not mean we don&#8217;t embrace new members to the RISD community.  On the contrary, it is exciting to expand the RISD family and forge new bonds.  Nor does it mean that old-timers like myself do not welcome changes and new ideas.  Unless we evolved, we would still be stuck with a typewriter and a mimeograph machine that I had to use for class syllabi and handouts when I began teaching!!  We would also be teaching 7 courses a year and spending the equivalent of 18 weeks of regular semester during Wintersession with no break at all before the beginning of spring semester (suicidal for both students and faculty!!).  We would also have to be at two places at the same time due to the lack of passing time between classes.  Neither would we have any professional development fund to support our professional endeavors, nor the new library that had been screaming for adequate space as long as I can remember.  I for one am grateful for those changes and look forward to new things to come.  </p>\n<p>However, with all the changes that we will embrace, one thing I don&#8217;t want us to neglect is the institutional memory and respect for the legacies left by our colleagues and predecessors. The celebration of faculty emeriti two weeks ago was very timely in this regard.  Because of their dedication, hard work, and wisdom to improve RISD education, community, and work environment, we are where we are and I want to salute them by preserving and expanding on their creation.  I also want to salute my faculty colleagues on campus, as well as those current and past staff members, administrators, and presidents, who also helped fashion RISD&#8217;s renown which we will continue to enrich.\n</p><p/></div>",

My job at RISD is to manage Project Open Door in the Department of Teaching + Learning under Paul Sproll. I hope you continue to support projects like this one that provide under-served teenagers get access to college - they especially need financial aid. All the students we work with get into college (most get into college for art and design) but few get enough scholarship money to go. I hope RISD can increase financial support for our creative Rhode Island kids, so they stay in our town and help make it a more creative place (as RISD graduates have done for years).\n</p><p/></div>",

It&#8217;s kind of like the problem inherent to when you install lightbulbs everywhere &#8212; somebody has to go around and constantly check the lightbulbs and see when one has gone out, and replace it at a regular rate. My friend who is an expert in wi-fi says the majority of cost in the long run is on maintaining and managing a wireless network.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering when a technology changeover will take place where laptops will be embedded with internal mobile phone modems. Thus if your phone can register service where you are, your laptop will simply go to your mobile for the Internet. Since the mobile phone networks are fairly ubiquitous, it&#8217;s the easier way to connect to the Web. It&#8217;s not clear in what year in the future when that paradigm will occur.</p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is mesh networks. These are networks where laptops all cooperate to connect each other to form a network on the fly. Thus if one laptop is connected to the Internet, all laptops can access the Internet through the mesh of computers all tied together wirelessly. This would also be a way to enable ubiquitous and low-cost connection through simply a shared connection.</p>\n<p>To make a long story, it&#8217;s complex. If we all think together, we can eventually find the solution for the short term at least &#8230; and together work towards the long term.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Aaron, </p>\n<p>First of all, the key to making things happen is to get a lay of the land, open the conversation, and estabish the priorities. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing right now <i>together</i>.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the priorities of OIT are broad and have been institutionally deprioritized in lieu of the historical prioritization of the building projects on campus. As I am coming into all of this, I am shepherding the tail-end of the incredible campus expansion projects like 15W and Chace, and moving towards campus improvements that drive community. In my conversations with President Mandle he put it well that he had laid the groundwork for many things to happen at RISD with a larger physical infrastructure, and that I would probably be the one to enable connecting the various sites using ideas of needed virtual infrastructure to support greater campus connectivity. </p>\n<p>Thirdly, after discovering that even when I am within 5 bars of wi-fi access to a RISD network and it keeps timing out on me so that at least 10% of my time is spent re-connecting, I don&#8217;t think you need any convincing of me to know there&#8217;s some &#8230; issues &#8230; in wi-fi at RISD. </p>\n<p>Ah. I found it. There was an original discussion about wi-fi inside <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/04/21/sunny-risd/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>here</b></a> that we can build upon. </p>\n<p>On your question of my statement of a 100% wi-fi coverage number, it&#8217;s something that I would personally like in some form but now is fiscally impossible. And even MIT is not 100% covered. So I&#8217;m trying to figure out what is the right N% of reliable wi-fi coverage we need. What might need to exist (if not already) are the top ten &#8220;wi-fi&#8217;s gotta work here&#8221; sites. And we work from there to establish the priorities and see how we match to them currently. By getting key specific sites working right, we have a platform for discovery and to determine how to move outwards from there.</p>\n<p>I would imagine one of the top ten will be the new student lounge in the building with the RISD store. What do folks think are in that top ten? The RISD beach? Prioritizing public areas with the most concentration of people in areas that are inconvenient for a wired network are likely the most important target. What are the top ten right now? Speak up, RISD.</p>\n<p>Regards, John\n</p><p/></div>",

Undoubtedly that would be a very desirable project for a department were they given the mandate/money to do it. Sounds like from the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/04/21/sunny-risd/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlier thread</a> that this is being looked at carefully. Echoing Andrew Mau&#8217;s comments, a few additional boxes per floor would do the trick in Fletcher, where some 90 grads spend more than half their time. A wi-fi box exists on 2 of the 6 floors, but they don&#8217;t have the strength to permeate the thick walls. Our best access has been the 6th floor computer lab which can put a damper on the stream of things. </p>\n<p>In thinking about what the priorities are, I would  vote for classrooms, studios, dorm fixes over a campus percentage or &#8220;new coverage&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think as many RISD students carry their internet ready devices (laptops, handhelds etc) to public areas to do work as they do to their studios, dorms&#8230; this is certainly the case for studio-based students at least&#8230; very interested in how others see this.

Whether these studios and the students in them use computers in their work or not (used for reference, research) having wi-fi studios should be top of the list I think.</p>\n<p>Next would be places that students congregate like eateries and lounges (student space, portfolio, met, library (I would argue against the beach because it is usually impossible to see a laptop out there anyways).</p>\n<p>So I think wi-fi locations breakdown like that and it is really hard to pick ten because that would mean either putting work ahead of pleasure or vice-versa and/or picking studios over others.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Just wanted to mention a few things about WiFi at RISD and what is going on, relative to planning our next steps:</p>\n<p>1: WiFi at RISD grew in direct correlation to the Laptop Program.  In those areas, WiFi is fairly prevalent (including Design Center and many of the buildings in Aaron&#8217;s note).  However, a building like DC presents certain &#8220;design challenges&#8221; since the building construction is difficult at best.  Other buildings such as 161 SM where open wood construction provides for an easier flow of the airwaves.</p>\n<p>2: I too have noticed in areas of seemingly good coverage, signals seem to drop.  While I can&#8217;t exactly say what the problem is.. I can say that if I walk down Main Street with my Laptop or now the Iphone, I can pick up at least 10 -15 other WiFi networks in the area.  Since there are only a limited number of channels wireless signals can use&#8230; many times as I get closer to one of these competing networks, my signal drifts.. toward the other network -dropping from roamabout.  This can also happen while inside certain buildings.</p>\n<p>3: New WiFi technology is upon us&#8230; its call &#8220;N&#8221;&#8230; or 802.11n, which rivals the speed of current wired networks and offers greater security and other enhanced features over our existing WiFi network.  Trouble is, as John mentions, it&#8217;s not cheap.  As I understand it , one new feature of &#8220;N&#8221;  is, this new technology has what&#8217;s called  a &#8220;self healing&#8221; component, where if an AP (access point) fails, the new technology will boost the signal of neighboring APs to make up for the loss in signal.  We are already looking at possible solutions for our next generation WiFI and will keep you posted as things progress.</p>\n<p>4: We are also evaluating other more commercial &#8220;private&#8221; broadband offerings such as T-Mobile and Sprint for example as a possible option.</p>\n<p>5: Aaron.. I hear the requests for WiFi in the dorms too, so our evaluation also includes this as well.</p>\n<p>I like the &#8220;top ten&#8221; idea as well.  We are already working with Deans and Department Heads to review their spaces and have asked to get us their most demanding WiFi areas. </p>\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;m not sure we can get to the 100% coverage, but I can say that today&#8217;s WiFi environment is comprised of about 140 access points.. and to get somewhere close to 90%  &#8212; we would need (in our rough estimate) about 400+.</p>\n<p>Just wanted to tell you we are committed to upgrading our WiFi footprint in the near future.<br/>\nStay tuned for additional information.</p>\n<p>John.. Could we meet with your WiFi person, I forgot his name - would like to get his feedback on this as we continue our planning.</p>\n<p>Regards<br/>\nRalph\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Prof Keefer, Yes you point out the critical issue of Google mail in general. This includes Yahoo! and any other &#8220;free&#8221; service out there as well. Around two years ago I was fairly adamant about not using Google mail for this mining question. However along the way I realized that many students really had no problem with the privacy question. It stymied me in the beginning, but realized that for the students&#8217; generation that there is a different feel for the privacy issue &#8212; this is why it is being rolled out for students. At most universities/colleges they have made it an option for faculty/staff. For myself in short, I&#8217;ve given up and embraced Google wholeheartedly and simply do not engage in any e-mail conversation that would be of a strictly confidential nature. Do I trust Google completely? Maybe yes; maybe no. But in general I err on the side of acknowledging that electronic privacy does not exist today.</p>\n<p>Even with RISD&#8217;s groupwise e-mail it is impossible for it to remain completely private from tampering. Hackers can break into anything today: e-mail, voicemail, and even encrypted information. For instance I was surprised to learn that with groupwise a sender can tell whether or not a recipient has opened an email. Oddly I felt that more of a violation of my privacy than a generic e-mail system. So in essence, Google mail leaves the question of scrutiny of how an internal RISD person might misuse one&#8217;s email, and simply opens it up to Google&#8217;s algorithms and servers.</p>\n<p>I believe that people who will attempt to try and realize completely secure e-mail are likely going to have to live as &#8220;anonymous ids&#8221; that have been validated through a variety of contortions in setting up an account on Google or Yahoo or what-not. </p>\n<p>This is a great discussion to have.

Our GW post offices are encrypted, but using these other access methods opens one up to sniffing email messages. Hackers are out there - so beware!</p>\n<p>Also true, one can elect additional levels of email security, ssl, encryption, etc. but is it worth it?</p>\n<p>As for Google, yes, I too understand they data mine email as you point out, and also true that many of the institutions who have gone Google, have elected to implement students &#8212; initially &#8212; and provided for an opt in - for faculty and staff, mainly due to these privacy concerns.  While Steve McDonald and I (mostly Steve) have been working with the Google legal folks - attempting to tweak the contract - I&#8217;m not sure they will remove the data mining component.</p>\n<p>That being said, all of these SaaS (John help with a link here) applications offer many new and exciting (and many free) applications to many industries, including Higher Education. Connecting to the &#8220;nerds out there&#8221; post, I think it important to look at any and all of these applications, as they have tremendous potential - as indicated via Google Apps For Education as an example. Obviously, this is a relatively new industry, but one that seems to offer new tools and technologies almost daily. However, we must always look under the covers and assess compatibility and support issues as we begin to fold them into the mix.</p>\n<p>-best<br/>\nRalph\n</p><p/></div>",

This hybrid blog is a small but important example of what the new Web team is capable of putting together, and it is given real meaning by the many people reading it regularly and participating as a community member. So no matter what our future website looks/feels like it will not achieve any real heights unless all of the community finds ways to regularly participate. Thank you for *your* participation. </p>\n<p>I ask you and all your student colleagues to bring the big ideas to the table that we can talk aloud about to plot our 100-year course forward as RISD. What does it look like in 2108? Show us the world that only students can see and want to make happen for the world. It&#8217;s not just our RISD we&#8217;re talking about, but our World. It will be *your* world as we older folks are not likely to live as long as you. Your generation must constructively lead us there by your collective good examples. We of the generations that come before you count on you and successive future generations to take our world there. We build that together by becoming one team, and we start along that path by learning how to behave as one RISD. </p>\n<p>There is such great meaning to what John F Kennedy said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&#8221; I was born in the 60s and actually named after him like many &#8220;John&#8221;s of my era. JFK&#8217;s simple words ring of the challenge to be part of a team as the responsibility that comes with being a member of the team. And at the same time the team counts that the Coach bears the responsibility to get the team there. On the best Website in the world, on focusing on scholarships, on energizing the mission around educational passion, on sustaining what is great about RISD&#8217;s history, on appreciating the many people that keep this place going, and whatever this team needs from its Coach you have that commitment in spades. So go out there and play ball and keep asking out loud and getting other students to also ask out loud simply &#8220;what can we do for RISD?&#8221; I see it happening among the staff, I see it happening among the faculty, and I see it happening among the students, alums, trustees, Providence community, RI community, and friends all over the world.</p>\n<p>So I have completed my first official two weeks and am exhilarated by what RISD is by its people and asks what it also wants to be. As I teach my 16-year old how to drive today, I am reminded by the simple rule of &#8220;You drive towards where you are looking.&#8221; I look forward to continually hearing from everyone what they see &#8220;out there&#8221; and sharing it as part of this set of open conversations in our community. Your dreams are our dreams, and we should always be dreaming big. And before we know it, we&#8217;ll all have arrived &#8230; ready to realize the very next dream.</p>\n<p>On this strand of &#8220;What needs to go?&#8221; we have the drinking water arena fleshed out, the older website design too on another strand, and &#8230; <i>what else?</i> AND <u>in the same breath</u> you can offer <i>what can be constructively offered as a new solution to be critiqued?</i> We walk forward in the traditions of a RISD that thinks, breathes, responds, behaves, unites as an unparalleled community of creative thinkers, doers, teachers, and learners.</p>\n<p>Regards, John\n</p><p/></div>",

I offer these in a spirit that I hope is similar to the spirit in which you offered yours.</p>\n<p>1. <em>Do no harm.</em> This seems obvious enough, but if you keep in mind that doctors always intend to do good, it&#8217;s interesting to hear it expressed in this way. Often, harm comes in spite of good intentions.</p>\n<p>2. <em>Get a second opinion.</em> This sounds more like an idea that would occur to the patient, but more than one doctor has made that recommendation to me recently. This requires humility. Of course, any doctor understands that an opinion from a member of his/her own team does not constitute a second opinion.</p>\n<p>I wish you the best as you begin your term as RISD&#8217;s president.</p></div>",

If RISD is dysfunctional (and I don&#8217;t believe it is), a careful examination of that is needed before important decisions are made that could make matters worse. Or, assuming we&#8217;re not totally dysfunctional, it might be helpful if we stopped viewing everything through the lens of administration/faculty and began to trust each other&#8217;s intentions to do good rather than to mischaracterize them in the most negative light possible. In this environment, a second opinion might mean listening to someone from the other side of that divide or whatever other RISD fault line you choose before reaching a conclusion or making a decision that could have far reaching consequences, both intended and unintended. That&#8217;s what I meant when I said a second opinion must come from someone who is not already a member of your team, and I wasn&#8217;t speaking of outside critics (or consultants). There is a need for a healthy conversation here. This blog is a start and not speaking ill of each other is just the opener.\n</p><p/></div>",

Briefly described, this experimental display system will be fed with information via the RISD intranet calendar and other sources and then distributed to signs in the following locations: The Chace Center first floor lobby, 15 West, CIT Building, The Design Center, The Met, and Woods-Gerry. The initial beta launch of the system is targeted for September and Samsung has generously donated <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/samsung-750-series-touch-of-color-lcds-due-in-may/\" target=\"_blank\">gorgeous 52-inch televisions </a>(approximately worth 20k) to help us in this foray into digital sign creation.

As you can guess, I will be wanting RISD&#8217;s intranet in the future to be a true intranet with SSO (single sign-on) so that all the back end services can be connected as a real intranet. The OIT folks have been working hard and well to satisfy many on-campus goals, and I think that with my coming on board on June I will want to start the process of  getting key parts of our IT infrastructure more prioritized as an institution to build more paths to: 1) better community, and 2) leadership in IT practices. -John</p>\n<p>Hi JamesD, I&#8217;m good friends with the founders of Poptech and have begun initial discussions for how RISD might get involved.

Instruction from the sideline surely<br/>\nsuggested I draw the negative space which the figure activates but,<br/>\nI like many, see the character as the subject.</p>\n<p>I could actually be wrong but an affirmation of this recollection<br/>\nwould rely on my ability to have captured his essence on a<br/>\nnewsprint pad. Do I dare go back and face myself, searching for<br/>\na drawing that didn&#8217;t faithfully portray the individual before me?<br/>\nWould I realize how wrong I was to assume they were posing<br/>\nfor my needs of expression, and still not understand that it was<br/>\nabout the transference of their expression?</p>\n<p>Or am I actually remembering countless drawings by others<br/>\non the walls of the Waterman Building that informed me more<br/>\nabout the things that I did not see or achieve with this figure?</p>\n<p>Rice and I remained acquaintances ever since we first met.<br/>\nHe had the ability to move around the RISD Campus before one existed.<br/>\nFrequently we would see each other in locations that had nothing to do<br/>\nwith the school. If he was there, it always extended my notion of the campus. </p>\n<p>Sometimes there was a pattern to the encounters, his brisk linear walking<br/>\ntoward and away from the campus, became morning and night.<br/>\nA visit to the copy center was a glimpse of his pause at noon.<br/>\nAn afternoon exchange in a hallway, while I retrieved an item from a locker,<br/>\nor got a book from the library. Every time we saw one another<br/>\nthere was a brief exchange on a wide variety of previously started topics,<br/>\nhe was incredibly attentive and maintained many diverse interests.</p>\n<p>I can honestly say that I have seen him moving around RISD<br/>\nmore than any other single person over the past 20 years. </p>\n<p>As electronic instant communication guides us to greater knowledge,<br/>\none should pause and consider what physical encounters they<br/>\nhave missed in some place or passing.

I quickly realized, through these conversations (maybe once a week or so, in the Library) that I was a mere novice in these matters, and Rice was definitely a master.  We could talk about the famous, the semi-obscure, or the truly obscure, and I&#8217;d end up lost.  Rice could go on about Monty Clift, Jo Van Fleet, or Carroll Baker, and I&#8217;d love to hear his thoughts on each one.</p>\n<p>One conversation in particular caused me quite a shock, as Rice revealed a strong distaste for the movie &#8216;Houseboat&#8217; (with Cary Grant and Sophia Loren).

        "content": "<div><p>Rice was one of the first people I met when I started working at RISD two years ago. I was immediately drawn to his friendliness and, admittedly, his strangeness. I feel we hit it off well from the beginning. He always had an interesting story to tell even if it was the same exact story over and over again. But that never seemed to be a problem. It was always in the way he told them. There was a certain joy to his voice that made you want to listen. </p>\n<p>Those of us who knew Rice can say that his stories were always to be taken with a grain of salt. I believed that for a long time, especially with a specific tale he loved to tell about once being recognized in public as Lionel Richie. I didn&#8217;t see any similarity to Rice and the pop singer whatsoever and brushed the story off as being highly embellished. That is, to say, until he brought in an old ID of his from the early 80s, and low-and-behold he was a dead ringer for Richie (and John Oates, for that matter). Since that specific incident I took Rice&#8217;s long-winded tales with a bit more seriousness than before. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m grateful to have gotten to know Rice for the short time that I&#8217;ve been employed here. He was my main source for the New York Times crossword puzzle, which he would solve in 30 minutes and I would spend weeks trying to complete without cheating. I still have a few puzzles sitting on my desk right now which I feel I shouldn&#8217;t throw away. It&#8217;s funny, but the puzzle became such a standard routine for us I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll ever be able to work on one again without thinking about him.</p>\n<p>After hearing this horrible news I can&#8217;t help but feel guilt for all the times I was a &#8220;grump&#8221; to Rice when I just wasn&#8217;t in the mood. &#8220;Grump&#8221; became the term of endearment Rice would use for me, which I found highly insulting. I like to think of myself as being someone with high spirits, but I suppose Rice did catch me on a few bad days and I never heard the end of it! Rice was full of inside jokes. Apparently I also enjoyed viewing nude photographs of Brittney Spears on my computer, as Rice would take joy in announcing to whomever happened to be in the room at the time. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I suppose I could go on and on. I&#8217;ll end by saying that I can&#8217;t seem to shake this guy out of my mind. Rice was a guy I was so used to seeing every day during the week. He was a really nice person, he genuinely cared for people as far as I&#8217;m concerned, and I think I&#8217;m truly going to miss having to put up with him. </p>\n<p>John Gambino<br/>\nGuy in the Copy Center\n</p><p/></div>",

I always knew when Rice had a cold he would walk through my office door carrying a bunch of carrots and fresh ginger with a bow.<br/>\n     I will miss his weekly visits to give me coupons, monthly when the weather was to hot, he wasn&#8217;t fond of the humidity.  I will miss him walking around campus in his shorts when there were five inches of snow on the ground.  I will miss his rhymes like,&#8221;Deb Domaingue who lives down the lane who had so many children she always looked drained.   There are so many I will miss that I could go on all day.

He would call out &#8220;Here&#8217;s the Lady in Red&#8221; when he saw me coming, and usually open the conversation with &#8220;So what have you seen, lately?&#8221; and then we&#8217;d start our movie chat and both would forget the time.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know Rice as a model, but do know he had many other interests. He designed clothes, was a figure skater, loved the ballet. He was a great racconteur. When I told him about my <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/museum_educ_freeforall.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free-For-All</a> partnerships in the community, he expressed an interest in going along to watch. At the Flynn School in South Providence, he went from observer to quietly suggesting how 5th grade students could better make their hats, the theme for this particular event. He was soon leading the project, and kids eagerly looked forward to the arrival of &#8220;Mr. Rice&#8221; every week. Under his guidance, every child in the class made an amazing hat which actually fit them. Hats featured everything from pop-up images of sports heroes or the Dominican flag to giant crepe paper flowers. Ribbons, tulle, pictures of endangered animals from <em>National Geographic</em>, pi&#241;ata toys. Rice encouraged kids to create with anything and everything. The students displayed their finished creations in the Museum&#8217;s Education Gallery for the Free-For-All and I remember Rice was late to their exhibition that day and many kids were worried he might not make it. When he finally arrived, everyone started beaming and clapping, and parents and grandparents ran over to shake the famous Mr. Rice&#8217;s hand. One grandma asked if it was true that his last name was A&#8217;Roni.\n</p><p/></div>",

He had great reflections on the likes of Dizzy, Dinah Washington, Little Jimmy Scott, and Big Mama Thornton to name a few.  He was always (!!) able to top my best story of some celebrity or icon I&#8217;d met, knew, or had connections to. Darn, Rice (smile!)</p>\n<p>Seems like the only time we would run into each other was in the college building&#8211; even after the copy center moved to the Design Building. For some reason, the college building remained a &#8216;home&#8217; for him.  He would share stories of his dance days in NY and his love of ballet. What a well-rounded individual! </p>\n<p>As Lucy King has shared, Rice was the figure model for many of my Foundation Studies drawing and Sculpture department classes.

I know some people thought he had too much of a presence in the building, but he was really such an important part of our way of life, too - watering and feeding plants, giving directions to people who naively believed that 2 College Street meant 2 College Street,  discouraging the occasional unwanted visitor, reaching things that were too high for a woman of 5&#8242;2&#8243; but were just right for a man of 6&#8242;4&#8243;. In addition to his amazing stories and relentless puns, he brought us gifts of bread and fruit and the occasional latte, distributed coupons that he had no need for and knew his friends could use, tried to teach me to sew, tried to learn to knit from me, moved boxes that were too heavy for us to move.  As John Gambino mentioned, he would copy puzzles and cartoons and distribute them to people who would enjoy them.  He was just the heart of our little family.\n</p><p/></div>",

He didn&#8217;t even have a telephone or heat or hot water in his apartment. But he enjoyed life with only the bare essentials, and I think his art and fashion flourished because of it.  He was a true bohemian who celebrated nonconformity and spontaneous creativity. </p>\n<p>I never grew tired of listening to his stories about hanging out with John Waters and Mink Stole, seeing Velvet Underground and Janis Joplin at RISD, and visiting clandestine local watering holes, like Mamas Metro, Safari Lounge and Playland. He lived for the theater and after hearing about his years watching and participating in NYC dance and off Broadway productions I developed a love for the theater myself. I&#8217;m now familiar with Beatrice Lillie, Gloria Grahame, and a host of other comediennes and character actors. He frequented little known jazz bars in Boston and New York and turned me on to all kinds of jazz and doo wop, like Jimmy Scott, Diana Krall, the Five Satins, Keely Smith, and on and on. </p>\n<p> What  Rice impressed upon me most was to express your inner self and not care what people think. To demonstrate he would  frequently enter the Picture Collection library yelling &#8220;Mr. Dave, I&#8217;ll have that sequined thong you ordered ready by next week, in time for your next performance&#8221; much to everyone&#8217;s amusement. My craziest ideas would always get his complete approval and encouragement. He might sound like a bad influence, but he was actually a mentor for the students, trying to get them to quit smoking and partying, and to concentrate more on their artwork. He really cared about people, and although Rice may not have had any immediate family members, I think the world was Rice&#8217;s extended family. Whenever I took the bus with him bus drivers and passengers alike would always want to be entertained by his colorful conversation. If you ever had a problem he was always there to lend a listening ear and even a little joke to show you the humor in the situation.  He was a funny, upbeat and positve person and his whimsical creativity brought out the artist in all of us. I don&#8217;t know how we can possibly inform all the myriad citizens of Providence that Rice &#8220;must depart these hallowed halls&#8221; because he knew so many. He was fun, and in the words of Chuckles the clown, he was &#8220;a little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.&#8221;\n</p><p/></div>",

Over the past year I found myself in charge of clearing the College Building of many of Rice&#8217;s packratted items.  And, then, one sad duty that a few of us were honored to be placed in charge of after his death, was to go to Rice&#8217;s apartment to go through his things looking for personal items, of which we found amazingly, pretty much nothing.  </p>\n<p>I bring this up not to criticize Rice, but to point out an intriguing and very impressive aspect of his personality.  Rice, unlike myself, had no need to collect personal paraphernalia to prove to himself who he was, but instead collected items such as&#8230; material of course, as that was, possibly, his biggest love (but before packing these away he would bring them to his friends and acquaintances and share with them the amazing beauty and quality&#8230;color&#8230; texture of the material&#8230; how it draped).  He packed away finished and half finished copies of the New York Times crossword puzzle, but most of what he saved were art supplies, because, as he explained to me, he felt that it was important that they be available for any student who might be in need of something.  </p>\n<p>Many of these items have made their way, and more will be going there soon, to the 2nd Life Recycling Center, in Rice&#8217;s name.</p>\n<p>One item that I did find in Rice&#8217;s apartment was a framed drawing.  It was kind of dark and mysterious looking, and what I would call formal&#8230; I didn&#8217;t recognize the artist&#8217;s name, or the picture itself and couldn&#8217;t tell the background of the piece, so I had the Museum take a look at it.  I&#8217;m pleased to say that they felt that this was an important piece and accepted it as a gift from Rice Gattis, which I feel is a fitting tribute to a man who left so many things behind, which at first didn&#8217;t seem to speak directly of him, but which turned out to speak to the heart of Rice - his love of art, RISD, the RISD students and the RISD community, which, after all, is his family.\n</p><p/></div>",

He was a Victorian/Edwardian painter in the grand academic tradition, most noted nowadays for his paintings of angels who resembled elegant little girls or young women. In the early 20th C.,he developed a bit of an idee fixe that all coloration in nature was camouflage, including paintings to depict his idea that flamingoes could hide against the sunset and that peacocks would pose so that their necks would blend with the sky while their body would blend with the surrounding foliage. On the basis of these writings and paintings, he was asked to help develop camouflages by the War Department during WWI, which he did, even inventing the well-known &#8220;dazzle&#8221; camouflage for warships, based on the principle of breaking up the silhouette. Evidently, his working methods also prefigured the standard digital workflow, as well.

His basic ideas have made me wonder what happens when you videotape a first-person experience of holding an object with hands similar to your own as displayed in the video. Does your mind reconstruct some of the tactility better? I have a hunch that it does by a few percent. How do we increase that percentage of sensation?

        "content": "<div><p>Wow, you don&#8217;t give easy assignments, do you&#8230;.</p>\n<p>1/ Your perceptions of the value of art/design education given the current local, regional, national, and international circumstances.<br/>\nWell, traditionally, education had as its purpose to enable &#8220;the good life&#8221;, meaning not a maxed-out 401k and three maxed-out credit cards, but a life where one was equipped to make substantive judgments and choose &#8220;virtue&#8221; accordingly. Critical thinking, the weighing of priorities, the incorporation of outside and/or expert input are all aspects of where the traditional liberal arts education overlaps with RISDs approach to arts and design. In addition, I would say that RISD also incorporates the hands-on, apprenticeship model of education, where aspects of mastery not easily or even practically analyzed or transmitted verbally are passed on. This is more akin to traditional apprenticeship in such fields as painting, sculpture, and monastic traditions.  </p>\n<p>The value of that sort of education&#8211;a good art and design education&#8211;is that it equips the student both to be a good person: one capable of making informed decisions about his/her own life and the lives of those in his/her care, and a good citizen at a variety of levels: local, national and international. Professional accomplishment and financial success are of course welcome, but ultimately they should come from being more aware and more responsible than others.</p>\n<p>The art and design education is analogous to the traditional liberal arts education in that it approaches similar goals,although through other means. Where it diverges somewhat from the liberal arts model is in the incorporation of the physical as a necessary and equal part of the plan. This adds (I think) recognition of and respect for the physical limitations and exaltations of human life that other forms of education are perhaps inclined to stress less, being primarily concerned with the outside and abstract aspects of life. </p>\n<p>2/ What you have so far gleaned about RISD.<br/>\nThat it  does that pretty well. There are excesses toward both directions, but in general that it seems to average out here. There always seems to be a respectful but nonetheless fierce Apollonian/Dionysian debate going on, but here it seems to play out in the form of theory vs. practice, where it is apparent to everybody that both sides are necessary for good work to be done. </p>\n<p>3/ What you believe to be the three most important things RISD should do within the next five years to retain its reputation for academic excellence and art/design innovation.</p>\n<p>1.) Maintain and improve infrastructure. Prosaic, but essential. Pratt was a very influential school until a combination of demographic changes in its neighborhood made it difficult to attract top students and offer great facilities. As a result, its reputation in a number of fields has slipped.</p>\n<p>2.) Reflect more of the world. This could be thought of as incorporating more &#8220;diversity&#8221;, but diversity without a purpose is just wanking. We want excellent students and teachers, but ones whose perspectives are genuinely different due to fundamental issues, not merely those of appearance or labeling. To that end, increased scholarship availability is essential, and some sort of evangelizing toward the idea that an arts education isn&#8217;t a waste of money or time, an attitude (or at least a concern) distressingly prevalent in many of our students&#8217; parents.</p>\n<p>3.) Improve its craft education. As the ostensibly non-intellectual side of the educational see-saw, as well as being decidedly un-chic in the art world until recently, craft&#8211; sheer ability to make good stuff has been given too short an end of the stick, I think. Craft can include a wide variety of aspects&#8211;a well made painting that looks beautiful, will hold up for many years, and betrays by its care in the making a respect for the viewer. It can be a well made program that crashes rarely if at all and shows a regard for the user&#8217;s needs. It can be a building that is not only beautiful and intellectually engaging, but doesn&#8217;t leak or bake the inhabitants and is made of materials that are sturdy and easily repaired.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Nick, I like your art/design-citizenship angle. Yesterday in New York I was speaking to a publisher at Conde Nast who felt that &#8220;art thinking&#8221; is a critical point of view missing in the national dialog.  Also the notion that an extension of a traditional liberal arts education incorporating the physical/expressive angle seems sound and important, and what RISD clearly strives to deliver. The former Dean of Humanities at MIT, my dear friend Dr. Philip Khoury, would often discuss with me how the devotee of humanism in light of the traditional MIT &#8220;make/hack/create/invent&#8221;-point of view will often sit on the opposite end of the spectrum with &#8220;analyze/theorize/understand/conclude&#8221; &#8212; his point being that MIT students were often best served by learning to &#8220;do both&#8221; &#8212; hybridizing the best of thinking in the liberal arts together with the best of doing in engineering/sciences. I see many collaborations between the liberal arts and the arts/design as seen in the current RISD catalog. Of course I don&#8217;t believe that everything has to be hybridized &#8212; otherwise it all becomes a sort of &#8220;grayish matter.&#8221; Multiple perspectives, as you point out as the core argument for *diversity*, are certainly the way forward in this century.

        "content": "<div><p>Dear John,<br/>\nI found your presentation this afternoon thought-provoking.  The priorities you identified seem very consonant with issues the faculty has discussed over the last few years: raising money for scholarships and academic excellence; also community-building.  I wish you great success with raising money for the first two purposes.  The blogs represent a whole set set of steps toward community-building, as does your affirmation of your own accessibility, &amp; possibly opening the President&#8217;s house a little.  One thing that has struck me this year is not how hard community-building is but how very easy it can be.  I&#8217;m having a pretty good experience at Tazza the last Tuesday of each month hosting a blues/poetry event with Mark Milloff.  It gathers in performers and audience from RISD, Brown, RIC, community organizations, Providence, Rhode Island, Block Island (State Poet Lisa Starr!), visitors from New York, Brown Music grads&#8211;it&#8217;s very inclusive &amp; it&#8217;s just fun<br/>\n(which you also recommend).  It&#8217;s a biggish event &amp; came out of no planning except Mark&#8217;s initiative.  I believe spirit can spark things.  Even a president-elect handing out pasta.  Before I came to America, I ran an arts center in Ireland.  I literally inherited the outcomes of my predecessors&#8217; spirit &amp; imagination.  It takes a lot of people to build and maintain an institution, but sometimes the spirit of one person makes an enormous difference.  I remember my friend Jenny Haughton deciding to lease an empty clothing factory in Dublin city centre from the city bus company, which was buying up all the property in the area in order to demolish it and eventually build an underground bus station.  Jenny wanted to turn the factory into art studios.  You also say Think Big!  This was thinking enormous &#8212; at a time when the biggest set of studios was in a Georgian house.  There was a lot of work attached, of course.  But there&#8217;s a lot of work attached to small ideas too.  I remember Jenny, seven or eight months pregnant, scrubbing the floors. She called it Temple Bar Studios.  Just as Peter said today&#8211;the establishment of the studios, and their association with the nearby Gallery of Photography, and Project Arts Centre (all started in similar ways) led to a rejuvenation of the area.  And the bus station was never built.  Temple Bar is almost a victim of its own success at this point, unfortunately, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Bar,_Dublin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Bar,_Dublin</a> but I learned many lessons about change and cultural transformation there, and in the Project Arts Centre, formed from the imagination of Jim &amp; Peter Sheridan, among others.  I saw so much happen &amp; participated in some of it.  All this is a long-winded way of saying I want one of those RISD faculty t-shirts you have (almost) designed.  I&#8217;d prefer to wear a t-shirt than an academic gown anyway, at Commencement.  Also, I wanted to ask the source of the 4 bold moves for the future of the world quote: you talked us through the points, but I missed the source.  I was interested in Gabriel&#8217;s point too, and thought of Deleuze &amp; Guattari&#8217;s &#8220;What is a Minor Literature?&#8221;  Also, how well used to *not* being first the majority of people are, e.g., all those who have been designated second-class, in one way or another.  It would be interesting to come up with new understandings of ranking.<br/>\nSpring is here &amp; the cherry blossoms are loading the trees, hooray.<br/>\nMairead\n</p><p/></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>Hi RISD,</p>\n<p>I spent today doing a rough assessment of open-source systems that might be connectable and help to solve 80% of the questions of how to enable <em>the option</em> for more educators here at RISD to leverage some useful tools to get their academic passion out onto the Web in as painless a fashion as possible while the CMS cooks in the oven.</p>\n<p>The first is Google Apps Sites. This will enable the easy construction of personal webpages for Faculty to maintain a CV, upload recent publications, photos, blogs and so forth. The platform works well for individual pages, and could also be leveraged for departments as well. You can learn more about it <a href=\"http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/users/sites.html\">here</a>. I&#8217;ve tested it myself and feel that it is more than sufficient but that is just me. You can watch a video about the whole Apps suite <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY2bpr1TAA4\">here</a> or just one on the Sites aspect <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_KnC2EIS5w\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly, when I spoke to Dean <strong>Barbara von Eckardt</strong> the other day, there was a question about how RISD can connect with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment\">Course Management System</a> world that has gained ground in the last decade in many schools. This means a system that enables an instructor to maintain an online syllabus, discussion group, as well as manage all grading and feedback online. The open-source leader in this area is <a href=\"http://moodle.org/\">Moodle</a>. I installed Moodle on my Mac about 4 years ago and used it to teach several classes and it worked great. A search on the Web revealed that Whittier College uses it to run their entire Registrar and Course Catalog online so it verifies the viability if that were RISD&#8217;s interest.</p>\n<p>Thirdly the question is how can all these disparate systems connect together in a hypothetical world. I&#8217;ve found some connectivity between Google Apps and Moodle, so that seems available. The advantage of an open system like Moodle is that it can be modified by anyone &#8212; customizability is key.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I know there&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.digication.com/\">Digication</a> in use at some parts of RISD &#8230; are there any other systems out there that Students/Faculty are experimenting with? That would be really useful to know. One that comes to mind is student <strong>Adam Meyer</strong> and <a href=\"http://www.risdpedia.net/index.php/Main_Page\">RISDpedia</a>. Another would be the <a href=\"http://risd.dailyjolt.com/\">Daily Jolt</a> (who started that and when?) What else is out there?</p>\n<p>Thanks, John</p></div>",

I took pictures of every slide we went over in class, made a PDF, and put them up on there. This way, anyone could have their notes connect to an actual image.</p>\n<p>As you mentioned I do RISDpedia. I do see this becoming a great resource for people. The problem is the right now it is a catch22. There needs to be a ton of information in there before people have a reason to come, and the information wont be there unless people use it.</p>\n<p>So I entered a few hundred entries, wrote some god articles, and then got a job so I could bribe people to enter it. So far it hasn&#8217;t worked.</p>\n<p>BUT&#8230; I have plans to make it work better. It does require that it work for more than just RISD. By opening it up to all students, I think we can get it going.</p>\n<p>But I also have plans for it to be a great blog full of interviews with your favorite artists and the products and materials they use.</p>\n<p>But right now it is on pause. I sadly took 6 jobs this summer, so for now, I don&#8217;t have too much time for it.</p>\n<p>But computing at RISD is a little strange. I stated a blog for my last studio class where we could all share research we found on folding bikes (we where designing one).

I started this with the calendar app I was making, but it also pulls in a many databases of information.</p>\n<p>This would be a wiki for RISD (Not RISDpedia, though maybe I can give up the name.) Think, everything known about RISD in one place (Objective information.. locations around campus, information and everything and anything related to RISD. Alumni etc etc etc).</p>\n<p>The wiki would be tied in with an all knowing all updatable, tell me what I can see tonight calendar (events linked to articles about the club location etc in that above wiki). </p>\n<p>This all knowing calendar would be tied in to the digital signs around campus so you can see on the left side of the screen at all times, what is happening around campus TODAY.</p>\n<p> RISDpedia tied in with the RISD store and metcalf store with kiosks and a barcode reader (Anyone could scan in a product, the RISDpedia page would come up so you can read more about it and see how well it works). And have it tied into 2ndlife. (Need pink foam, well this is showing that 2nd life has some)</p>\n<p>Also student web space.

The majority of supersavvy folks will always have adam-meyer.com instead of an institutionalized parking spot. We saw this at the Media Lab as a rational strand. As for the CMS-y templates I agree they aren&#8217;t perfect but if there is enough usage proven by students building pages there I will personally lobby the Google folks to let us use our own customized CSS templates. I believe we live in an era no longer of we build a great custom system (like your great portfolio.risd.edu idea) and instead leverage existing working parts available in the open and simply integrate them better than anyone else. Like better uses of Flickr and other available systems instead of rolling your own. I completely get the joy and excellence of a custom system from scratch &#8212; but I believe the real magic now happens in the customized leaves (versus a customized hub). An example in your Portfolio case would be building a customized 3d browser that uses g-speak, or a customized analytics module that traverses the portfolio content and discovers useful waya to leverage aggregates of interesting data. Think Web 3.0 and 4.0 and we leave Web 2.0 for the catch-up crowd. Keep the ideas and thoughts coming! Thanks, John\n</p><p/></div>",

While the recent focus of this project has been on international collaboration, we&#8217;ve had some of our greatest success with the project locally; in the ways that it created an environment in which students paid more attention not only to the work being made by their colleagues but were also able to engage in a dialog with this work through practice.  We&#8217;re now working to better integrate the tools we developed for this project into existing video databases.  This work has gotten me interested in what this kind of project could do for the entire college.  Templates and showing work to the outside world are important but from the perspective of how a RISD education functions at RISD, adopting and building tools to visualize above all the connections between our practices AND between the various components of our curricula seems critical.  To me, this becomes a part of addressing some of the core issues, around creating integrated learning environments, that contemporary educators are working on all over the world.\n</p><p/></div>",

The concept was pretty simple:  People need easy ways to post their work and share it within a variety of communities (local, institutional, and global), and the tools for doing this should be flexible, easy-to-use, customizable, and aesthetically strong.  </p>\n<p>We succeeded in building something that was really useful for running studio-based courses, and really good at aggregating the work of the community, but really bad at giving users the kind of flexibility they experience with modular software like google apps.  </p>\n<p>In my view, the contrast between an &#8220;environmental&#8221; approach (like Digication) and a &#8220;toolbox&#8221; approach (like Google apps.) represents a key issue in thinking through how best, in John&#8217;s words, to help people &#8220;get their academic passion out onto the Web in as painless a fashion as possible.&#8221;  The nice thing about the &#8220;toolbox&#8221; approach is that it gives people a great deal of flexibility to build the kinds of sites and resources with the kind of interactivity they need.  The drawback is that the threshold for entry is slightly higher as is the potential for fragmentation.  The nice thing about the &#8220;environmental&#8221; approach is that it makes it easy to understand where you are and easy to find one another (and each other&#8217;s work) within a (pre-)aggregated domain.  The drawback is that you&#8217;re kind of wedded to a fairly uniform look and feel and fairly convention-bound ways of working.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to pay attention to both of these moments&#8212;the flexible/creative and the environmental/aggregative&#8212;in imagining our way forward.  Perhaps we don&#8217;t need to choose, but can easily figure out how to do some &#8220;both/and&#8221; here.</p>\n<p>My experience has also been that different people come to these technologies with very different needs and very different levels and kinds of experiences, and it&#8217;s important to have multiple ways of doing things available to them.  I also think that what is perhaps most important in all of this is to build a strong technology support community that we can all tap into for guidance and to help us stitch this thing together as we go forward. </p>\n<p>Great thread!

My instructor for instance loaded everything into Moodle as pdf&#8217;s, which was ever so annoying because I needed to download pdf&#8217;s to find what I was looking for, I&#8217;m sure Moodle has a way to have everything live within Moodle and not in pdf&#8217;s. Also, the instructor had the TA create an email list and distribute it to the entire class, which was redundant since Moodle built a contact list within itself once we all logged into it. I have to wonder what other tools we weren&#8217;t utilizing within the App. </p>\n<p>I would also note that some students had trouble navigating Moodle, lots of us who are plugged in and run our own blogs and have Flickr accounts and Facebooks and use RSS, etc. have a really short learning curve, there are others who struggle.

In *very* general terms:</p>\n<p>Section 11.1 seems to be pretty good.  It says you&#8217;re *not* giving up *ownership* of any copyrights to your materials by posting them to or transmitting them through Google, but that you are giving Google permission to use your copyrighted materials to do those things &#8212; and, it appears, *only* those things &#8212; that are technically required to perform the functions you&#8217;ve requested it to perform.  Since the Internet is really, in a sense, just one big photocopier &#8212; everything you do on the Internet involves making and distributing copies &#8212; and since making and distributing copies are at the heart of copyright law, Google needs that permission.  A court would almost certainly find such permission to be implied even in the absence of a written agreement, but a written agreement never hurts.</p>\n<p>Section 11.2 is less clear.  It also involves giving Google a license to use your materials, but the license goes beyond what is strictly necessary to perform its basic e-mail and other technical functions.  Just how far is unclear, because there&#8217;s no definition of who the &#8220;other companies, organizations or individuals with whom Google has relationships&#8221; are or what the &#8220;syndicated services&#8221; they&#8217;re providing are.  It may simply be that Google is &#8220;outsourcing&#8221; some of the technical aspects of providing its services, in which case this wouldn&#8217;t go (much) beyond the license in Section 11.1, but it might be something more or different.</p>\n<p>Section 11.3 seems to be an elaboration of Section 11.1, noting that the technology may modify your materials to some extent simply because that&#8217;s how the technology works &#8212; for example, an html-formatted e-mail may look a bit different in different e-mail clients or web browsers.  It doesn&#8217;t appear that they&#8217;re asking for permission or intending to modify the actual *content*of your materials, but just the format.</p>\n<p>Section 11.4 is a really critical one.  What it is saying is that you&#8217;re promising that you have the right to post or transmit whatever it is that you&#8217;re posting or transmitting &#8212; in other words, that you either own the copyright to it yourself, or you have permission from the owner to post or transmit it, or one of the applicable exceptions to copyright apply to your posting or transmission, or your posting or transmission constitutes fair use.\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;m wondering what&#8217;s not being said and who&#8217;s not participating and if there might be a way of bringing more people into these critical discussions by making them smaller. I find myself sometimes typing responses and hesitating to submit them, unsure if they belong in such a public space. For example, I was moved and drawn to the discussion on teaching that emerged with <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/30/student-professor-experiences/#comments\" title=\"furniture faculty process\">Rosanne&#8217;s post on the furniture faculty&#8217;s process and Sheila&#8217;s beautiful response</a>. I&#8217;d love to see this section expanded [I guess this is a second request for a thread, although maybe it is more complicated than that]. When I tried to compose an addition, however, I found myself struggling with submitting something so personal, as my thoughts on teaching are to me, all the while recognizing the value of having a discussion as open as this one has the potential to be.</p>\n<p><em>(Daniel&#8211; I am happy to create another discussion thread [more narrowly focused] &#8212; just let me know.

Prior to the blog/facebook/myspace explosion, when you finished your work day, you went home and started your personal life.  Now, your personal life sometimes acts as a vehicle to add dimension to your professional persona.  Do people see signs of caring or depth of feeling as signs of weakness?  Does that matter?  Walking the line is a slippery slope, and choosing the moment to go one step beyond professionalism is an art form in itself.  Ultimately, I believe that the world is made a better place by people who show they have feelings about things, whether positive or negative, and if we express ourselves in a genuine way in both our personal and professional lives, everyone will benefit.\n</p><p/></div>",

We disagree with our supervisors in private, but once a policy or decision is in place we do not attempt to discuss or change it in a public forum.  The crit is not the way we were trained to operate.  </p>\n<p>Some issues, like the useful discussion of bottled vs. filtered water, seem safe to discuss and have generated some interesting solutions and I am very interested in what Jef will report back about the vendor he&#8217;s seeing.  But I really can&#8217;t see a discussion about whether we grow or shrink enrollment, or compensation theory, or unionization or full time:part time faculty ratios taking place in a forum like this.  Although, in time, if the smaller discussion on less charged subjects go well and result in good outcomes, maybe the rest of us will feel safe to come out and play too.\n</p><p/></div>",

I think it was Scott that said, &#8220;Prof. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQqzcxa4yfY\"><strong>Mike Fink</strong></a> taught me how to write.&#8221; And it was Seth that said how when he was a student his eyes opened to a variety of unconventional Liberal Arts courses that lit the fire of his mind like, &#8220;Television and ______&#8221; (he couldn&#8217;t remember the name and maybe someone here can fill it in). They all speak of Foundation Studies as the RISD difference (&#8221;basic Jedi training&#8221;), and in the same breath pay homage to the incredible quality of facilities and faculty that grounded their fine art and design education. My favorite quote from Shep Fairey was his tint of proud bravado, &#8220;When I was at RISD probably the only one that could print better than myself was Prof. <strong>Henry Ferreira</strong>.&#8221; Implicit to this statement of chutzpah is a deep respect for the RISD environment. So in summary, I will be spending most of my first two years connecting with the many past supporters of RISD to generate excitement for whereever we will plan to bring <em>our</em> RISD in these coming years. The stories of RISD are what make <em>our</em> RISD unique, and I continue to search for more of them out there.</p>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello Matthew, I&#8217;ve heard that point made by many grad students. A teleportation device hasn&#8217;t been invented yet, so it&#8217;s still quite difficult to transport people across so many different spaces around RISD. RISD isn&#8217;t a very large school, but as we all know, even walking half a block sometime can seem longer than a plane ride to the West coast. Yesterday I was in a friend&#8217;s office at MIT &#8212; Prof Neil Gershenfeld. He wrote an influential book called &#8220;FAB&#8221; which talks about personal fabrication systems. But more interestingly, he actively uses a video bridge that connects over thirty sites in the world. When he wants to connect to Norway, he opens a channel to the other site and people casually chat during the day. It felt a lot like Star Trek. The system is different from a normal Webcam as it&#8217;s extremely high quality in resolution so it feels more &#8220;real.&#8221; Perhaps there is a way to connect public spaces of RISD with video links in the future. Something to think about, John</p>\n<p>Hello Anonymous-9:56, I have been reviewing the &#8220;Campus Master Plan&#8221; that was put in place from last decade as the blueprint for how RISD was to evolve physically. I will see if there is an online version somewhere so more people can review it as well. The document is quite comprehensive and thoughtful in many dimensions. I think there were always serious efforts to make more space for students in the past, and probably if you add up some sq-footage number you would see a significant increase in square footage dedicated to students (e.g. the new dorms). But I know what you are talking about in terms of &#8220;white canvas&#8221; spaces for making student imprints upon. At MIT some such spaces do exist aand they are often underutilized due to the simple fact that students have so much homework that they can rarely spend time congregating in a place separate from their own living space or lab (equivalent to studio at RISD) space. Studying often takes precedence over building community; it is the same in the non-academic world where work takes precedence over building community as well. We live in a highly connected, yet at the same time disconnected, world.<br/>\n     On your point of letting &#8220;students control any aspect of the RISD image&#8221; &#8212; this is something i heard from the Student Alliance once and thought it was an important point. There was a sense that RISD was on the &#8220;over-branded&#8221; side. I might suggest your picking up a new book out called &#8220;Authenticity&#8221; from Harvard Business School Press. In this book, I think many of the questions people have about what makes RISD great are in there &#8212; much of the yearning how RISD should feel &#8220;brand&#8221; wise are in there as well. The conclusion up front, is that RISD people are extremely *authentic* in their modes of art and design. Maintaining that authenticity is critical for RISD&#8217;s future success, and authenticity is not just about form but it is a battle for *substance*. I invite students to become more a part of defining what is substantive about RISD and then to find the form that best conveys those qualities. Be well, John\n</p><p/></div>",

Yes, work will dominate most of the time, but a growing number of students here feel that community is severely lacking and that it is something they want out of their college experience. Can&#8217;t we have some of both? </p>\n<p>And with regards to the RISD image, I don&#8217;t think anyone is questioning what makes RISD great. I think that many of the same students concerned with space are starting to feel that many of the decisions made in the last several years at RISD have been made, not in concern for the students, but for the donors and the alums. (the decision to build the Chase center for instance, and to move RisdWorks into it). These types of decisions really taint the RISD experience for students and make them feel that they have no control over their school and its image.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Aaron, Definitely do both. Please. If you google &#8220;do both&#8221; see who turns up as the top link (smile). I look forward to seeing students build as much community as possible and for the entire institution to help the students in whatever way imaginable &#8212; both virtually and physically. There are fewer things more powerful than student initiative and energy. Here at MIT one of the major initiatives in building community was a small group of students that began to hold a portable &#8220;tea with cookies&#8221; at 4PM every Thursday where the venue would shift from place to place. All it required was a big hot water pot, some teas, and some snacks. It also made use of the fact that there are many pockets of space all around, and that any given time it&#8217;s unlikely that *all* students would ever come. So it creates a casual nomadic space of community that has done very well here. I think there are many ideas like that to play with &#8212; I&#8217;m sure that RISD does many of them already and would like to learn how to build on current successes.</p>\n<p>On your second point, I&#8217;ve heard this concern voiced of doing it for &#8220;the donors and the alums&#8221; quite a bit. I think that may be especially felt because a major capital intensive thing like the Chace is happening right now on campus. The Chace will be up before we all know it (September I hear) and its impact is set in motion. The die is cast. Let&#8217;s see how we can work together to make it a win. </p>\n<p>From what I can tell I hear that the student space in the RISDstore is in the right direction. Having the right direction is everything, and not just for the RISD corner of the universe. I&#8217;m curious as to what students envision the kind of intellectual goals RISD will be working on in twenty/thirty years from now to help provide a map for what the future looks like. It will be a future you live much more than I or any other person of my generation. It&#8217;s your world.</p>\n<p>Best, John</p>\n<p>PS Oh yes an important thing that I learned to be careful about Chace is Cha<b>c</b>e. I know it&#8217;s easy to forget.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I just wanted to weigh-in on yesterday - I thought it was a great day and a great way to start the conversation on conversation!<br/>\nI thought the readings were really interesting. Collectively, I saw them as points of view and it gave me a lot to think about. I didn&#8217;t think of them as things I should like or dislike - I just took them for what they were. In the first one, I enjoyed learning how technology has influenced education and how degrees are valued. The second one was really interesting because it so clearly articulated the complexity of working in groups (something we do in ID all the time) and how technology can enable something really complex to become pretty simple. The third reading was particularly interesting to me because I heard Jimmy Wales speak at the Art Center Conference 3 years ago about starting Wikipedia, and I do love that something like this exists. The book that was so generously given to us, I scanned and ended up downloading another book on Servant Leadership onto my iphone so I could listen to it while doing other things. I was a student of Total Quality Management when I worked for Graco Children&#8217;s Products and again, I enjoy learning about techniques and methods. For me, servant leadership makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p>The speakers were amazing! Nike as a company may have reasons to be criticized, but I have never seen a Nike commercial that doesn&#8217;t make my heart race, my eyes tear up, and feel like I can &#8216;just do it&#8217;. I identify with the spirit of the athletes and the way @Radical Media presents that story totally gets to me. I loved hearing Jon Kamen talk about his industry and process and was super surprised to learn that one of my favorite students is his son Zack. Amazing again.<br/>\nFernanda Viegas was just fantastic - she presented her material so clearly and made it so understandable. I can&#8217;t wait to use Many Eyes and have told several people about it already. The example from dining and catering was beautiful!</p>\n<p>For me the speakers showed the power technology has to be another tool for us - from telling a story and to visualizing research. John and the RISD panel talked about how technology is changing and where we might want to go with it. I left the meeting feeling informed and awed.</p>\n<p>Of course, it always comes back to the day-to-day practicality - how can technology simplify what is complicated about my work? How can technology provide me with more free time? I think some of the answers were presented in both the readings and the presentations and some of it is up to me to try to incorporate into the department and into my life. </p>\n<p>I wanted to add that I loved what Lane Myer said about incoming students and how they will always know more about technology than we will, and that part of our job is to be a  &#8216;responder&#8217;. I am long over being intimated by what I don&#8217;t know, and really enjoy having a student (or just about anyone) explain something new to me. Art and design can be enhanced by using the tools of technology, but in the end, it all needs to be critiqued or responded to.</p>\n<p>Thank you for a day well spent.</p>\n<p>FYI - this is my first ever blog entry\n</p><p/></div>",

The first year, I was completely lonely and, as my notebook is my closest companion, I wrote about every single event &amp; posted it to British &amp; Irish Poets, a listserv I&#8217;m on.

Unfortunately, unlike Liz L, I have only a hazy interest in accuracy. Nevertheless, lonely no more, live reporting, during or at the end of the day when possible, continues to be a basic act of service.  When I saw what Liz L was doing I gave 3 cheers.

I dutifully selected my two  pieces and carefully cut and carved them so they fit well together.  When we brought our work into crit, one of my classmates totally blew my mind.  She brought in a metal tub with some ashes in the bottom.  She had burned two pieces of wood, and mixed the ashes together.  This prompted a fantastic debate on the validity of her solution.  Ultimately, those of us who had slaved away with the woodworking tools felt both diminished and inspired.  To this day, I look back on that crit whenever I feel like I need to reevaluate my stance on anything.

Shep had made some lightboxed printwork and Prof <b>Henry Ferreira</b> told Shep that the lightboxes were &#8220;no good.&#8221;  Ferreira went further by saying that the printwork was beautiful &#8230; but the lightboxes were poorly constructed. &#8220;You should have asked an ID student to put them together for you,&#8221; is what Shep remembers as the glue was visible and the construction was not perfect. My takeaway from this was that the any work exists in many dimensions. Figuring out which dimensions matter, and where one puts his/her efforts, is the name of the game. Often we are limited by time and financial resources to score a 10 on all axes. In my mind, a good critique defines the subjective axes of judgement, and where in an objective sense a work sits on those axes.\n</p><p/></div>",

When I was in Prof Gabriel Feld&#8217;s architecture studio back in the late 90&#8217;s, the project required us to address various aspects of a housing project, such as light, circulation, structure, and facade, etc. I remember him saying that the beauty of architecture is that you can get &#8220;unstuck&#8221; by selectively working on other aspects that would eventually help create a coherent (and hopefully elegant) body of work.\n</p><p/></div>",

One of my favorites to this day is the tale of the toaster: Hardu said that at any other design school, given the task of redesigning the toaster students would start to think about shaping and styling the housing, and maybe about the mechanics of operating the appliance. But at RISD, he told me, the students would be likely to start their exploration by toasting slabs of fresh bread over an open fire&#8211; perhaps on sticks&#8211; and pondering about what it means to cook bread. What does the bread look and smell like as it roasts? </p>\n<p>When Hardu shared those anecdotes with me I knew that I wasn&#8217;t in Kansas anymore, and that the way RISDfolk addressed design was somehow fundamentally very different from my own design training at CMU.

        "content": "<div><p>I remember my first crit in grad school, being so afraid I&#8217;d lose control of my body or voice; I watched the older students and how they handled the situation; there was one who was completely silent, I was struck by this posture that seemed to acknowledge, you might not know how to respond in the moment so perhaps it is best to but your body on pause and just take notes, I adopted it&#8230;for awhile.  Participating in the critique process as a student and professor, I&#8217;ve become interested in the underlying emotional experience of the crit, what is at stake and how we address this at the same time as addressing what is in front of us on the physical plane.  It seems to me that if we ignore this emotional plane we risk missing the heart of the experience and finding ourselves talking deeply without listening deeply.  I&#8217;ve attended some really brilliant critiques at RISD, where I&#8217;ve left so impressed with the depth and value of the feedback offered.  Still, I find myself wondering what impact the crit had.  Does offering insight that could bring a practice to a next level always help?  I often think of my mother who is a modern psychoanalyst and how her mentors write of waiting and creating a holding space, not insight or confrontation, as the ultimate skills of the therapist.  Of course our roles and goals are different but it seems like we have some lessons to learn from each other.</p>\n<p>This is coupled with my experience of the gaps in teacher preparation, as John mentioned elsewhere in this blog, most of us have no formal teaching training and, even if we did, I&#8217;ve never seen a training that addresses these less comfortable concerns in a substantial or sophisticated way.  I remember bringing a visiting critic in to my studio a couple of years ago for a crit and talking to her, afterwards, about a student who I didn&#8217;t know how to respond to.  She said, &#8220;maybe talking is not the way to reach him, perhaps you should take a walk.&#8221;  I was inspired by this and started a practice last year of offering walking office hours but the question of the heavy role placed on oral communication in crits remains an open challenge to me.</p>\n<p>When I was in Sweden last year, working with the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at Konstfack to help develop their new MFA in a field they were calling &#8220;Experience Design&#8221;, I proposed a workshop that brought together students, modern psychoanalysts and art professors to talk about the dynamics of transference and counter-transference at play in the critique scenario and how psychoanalysts think about them.  When I first proposed it, the department head told me an interesting story. When he arrived at Konstfack the now &#8216;Department of Interdisciplinary Studies&#8217; was called &#8216;Color and Form.&#8217; So the Interdisciplinary Studies Department grew out of a foundations dept and the faculty he was working with had been teaching in very different ways.  When he came to effect this transformation, the school hired a psychologist to come in and talk to the faculty about the coming change and the anxiety it might provoke.  As I researched this, I learned that the approach to psychology they were taking was not particularly innovative or contemporary [and it did occur to me that it might have been just as thoughtful towards the faculty and students to hire a psychologist to work with the department head:)] but I was still struck by this sort of administrative gesture that attempted to take some responsibility for/raise awareness about the feelings change can percipitate.  I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about it but the story stayed with me.\n</p><p/></div>",

The RISD crit is of a constructive form as I viewed during May. I personally have experienced about an equal number of destructive crits to constructive ones. What are people&#8217;s thoughts on the relationship between a <i>constructive</i> crit and a <i>destructive</i> crit? Professor Myer&#8217;s recent comment at the offsite about the need to consider whether being purely civil (as in the guidelines for this blog) is counter to a culture of artists and designers that want to ask difficult and unpopular questions. It&#8217;s a great <i>open</i> question.\n</p><p/></div>",

I can hear him saying it as I sit here.  </p>\n<p>I believe that art and design and making are about communication, at the end of the day.  At a base level, we are communicators.  And part of what we were learning to do as students at RISD was to be better, more focused communicators within our particular ouvre.  With that as a core belief, it is hard for me to really get behind destructive crits.  At my undergrad, they were the norm, often, with the result that there was a relatively high dropout rate.  The prevailing thought (to which I subscribed at the time) was that &#8220;if they can&#8217;t handle it, it is good that they leave.&#8221;  Machismo.  I am not proud of it, but there it is.  Because what actually happened was that the number of students (and therefore the number of contributors to our collective education) diminished dramatically year by year.</p>\n<p>As I went on to start my own practice, and then to become a teacher myself, I started to come to a different point of view on that.  I think is my job as an educator to find constructive ways to voice my thoughts about the work in front of me.  This does not mean that anyone should be coddled, but I do think it is my responsibility to be supportive as well as honest.</p>\n<p>Within my own department, my experience was that even when confronted with an idea that was difficult or unpopular, my faculty almost never went on the attack, that for the most part things were civil, which does not preclude being critical or honest.  In retrospect, I learned a lot more from the crits I have been a part of for the last two years than I ever did watching a colleague get flayed in front of the class.\n</p><p/></div>",

Civil on who&#8217;s terms?<br/>\nCommunication is a tricky proposition especially when it is reduced to<br/>\nJUST words. (Have I offended a writer, shouted, or did the caps key stick?) </p>\n<p>At a meeting I once attended someone once commented that an idea<br/>\nI had expressed was radical. I never used the word radical or intended<br/>\nto get that reaction. I was slightly offended, because I wasn&#8217;t being heard<br/>\nthe way I wanted to be heard. (Which is actually a foolish objective to have,<br/>\nif you really want to communicate with someone you have to listen to them too.)<br/>\nI thought my initial comment was just a dramatic creative response.<br/>\nThe response I received,  was actually enlightening, because it wasn&#8217;t expected.<br/>\nPerceptions always come into play, which in turn, re-inform what is<br/>\nbeing exchanged.</p>\n<p>To me, the most important aspect about a critique is that all the participants<br/>\nare pre-informed that you are going to engage in one. This shared agreement<br/>\ncreates it&#8217;s civility. It only works because all, who are involved in that forum, understand and agree to critically look at something through as many ways or interpretations as possible, good through bad.</p>\n<p>When the critique situation is initiated a separation must always occur,<br/>\nwhatever it is, &#8220;is put out there on the table&#8221;. Whoever was originally<br/>\nattached to it, agrees to receive any comment, in order to become<br/>\nmore informed about all the perspectives they have not seen.</p>\n<p>Feelings can initially get hurt, but they more often change or<br/>\nprompt further important developments.</p>\n<p>Quality is never insured and all the participants must also agree to create<br/>\nand monitor the civility and meaningfulness of the exchange.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the toggle switch would be useful as a blog icon.<br/>\nIt creates options.<br/>\nIf appears at the beginning of an entry, it announces<br/>\nI agree and want to critique these views, bring it on, please.</p>\n<p>Toggle switch up on this subject.\n</p><p/></div>",

When you get deep, you&#8217;re no longer living in the normal superficial mores of the &#8220;civil&#8221; world. The deeper the discussion, do the feelings get deeper or lessened? There&#8217;s the intellectual &#8220;ouch&#8221; (i-ouch) and the emotional &#8220;ouch&#8221; (e-ouch). Are they one and the same?

As a matter of fact, it was critiques that made me decide to begin participating in Student Alliance two years ago.  </p>\n<p>In response to Lane&#8217;s post, I agree that civility is a very relevant and important topic on campus.  Two of Roger Mandle&#8217;s monthly notes in the past year addressed civility.

M. Forni.  He talks about how being civil doesn&#8217;t mean sugar coating things or being passive.</p>\n<p>I have some general ideas about critique and specific observations of critique at RISD.  I&#8217;ll go from general to specific.</p>\n<p>I agree with John&#8217;s post on the thread about Student-Professor experiences no critique should be considered &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;.  Instead it is better to focus on what is learned from every experience.  The ability to suspend the natural emotional response of evaluating the experience and focus on what is constructive is not easy though.  I would say it is potentially the most difficult and worthwhile skill I have learned at RISD.</p>\n<p>I guess a critique is only &#8220;bad&#8221; if it is destructive or constricting to the potential to learn.  This can happen.  This spring the provost&#8217;s office organized a fantastic lecture on teaching by Ken Bain, author of What the Best College Teachers Do (featuring RISD&#8217;s Charlie Cannon).  The large RISD auditorium was filled to about 5%, but I found the experience to be one that changed the course of my education.  One topic was how constant evaluation can create an external motivation to work and cripple the internal motivation that is so key to deeper learning.</p>\n<p>This is getting a little longer than intended, but I&#8217;ll continue with specific RISD crit experiences. </p>\n<p>Two falls ago, during a critique with visiting critics from other schools, a peer of mine was told that she would be better suited to a technical school and she left crying.</p>\n<p>Last spring, a classmate of mine didn&#8217;t show up the morning of our final critique because he felt too much pressure and didn&#8217;t feel he could bear the stress of the crit.  </p>\n<p>Last fall I saw 4 or 5 of my classmates cry after interactions with a teacher.  This included undergraduate females, graduate level males, graduate level females and undergraduate males alike.</p>\n<p>This spring a classmate of mine had a relapse of a minor heart condition that is brought on by stress so he was not able to come to studio for the last week of the semester or our final critique.</p>\n<p>I noticed in the thread on teaching John mentioned a friend at the GSD who said there used to be a problem with critiques being too personal and students feeling like target practice.  I heard my own teacher say that overly harsh teachers &#8220;used to be a problem&#8221;, but things are better now.  This strikes as similar to saying &#8220;racism towards African-Americans was a serious problem in the 1920s, but things are better now so we don&#8217;t need to work on that anymore.&#8221;  That is clearly an extreme comparison and the vast majority of critiques I have had have been very constructive, but I believe in constant improvement.  Can&#8217;t we always be working to make RISD an even better place of learning and creativity?  I think the phrase &#8220;that&#8217;s just the way things are&#8221; rolls off the tongue too easily.</p>\n<p>Critiques are such a unique psychological and emotional experience that sometimes I think there should be a foundation class specifically on how to take critiques, and conversely how to give them in order to make the most out of each one.  I think this is an area where strong advising would be tremendously helpful because students are often reluctant to bring up issues with their teacher because they fear it will affect their grade or they will be labeled as weak.  Any thoughts on the role of advising?<br/>\nI appreciate that you have opened up this critique on crits John because it is such a large part of our lives that often passes without conscious scrutiny.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello Charles, </p>\n<p>I particularly noted how the words &#8220;constructive&#8221; and &#8220;constrictive&#8221; differ by only one letter. Although lexically similar, the intellectual distance that separates the two words is important to consider. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also useful to bring in the &#8220;real world&#8221; view of working with design clients or art galleries or publishing houses or research funders and so forth. You usually get two types: the civil benefactor, or the un-civil benefactor. A successful creative is able to manage both types of parties with <i>jiu-jitsu</i> fluidity. Thus I personally think it&#8217;s important for a student leaving RISD to be able to manage the good relationships and the bad relationships they may have out in the real world. Not saying that we want people leaving crits crying of course &#8212; we need some way of preparing everyone for what is a truly competitive world out there. </p>\n<p>It happens even to the best of us all the time. For instance, even with a favorable name in the creative world, I was often challenged. Some six years ago I found myself at Disney headquarters where I was driven in a limousine by smiling, constructive Disney people that kept telling me I was the best thing since sliced bread and that I *had* to be the one that would be designing the visuals for their largest parking garage project. Everything was going quite well until I ended up in the presence of some executive that had the most foul mouth I had ever experienced that repeatedly derided me for no apparent reason over the course of an hour&#8217;s time. At the end, I calmly thanked him for his comments and went home and shifted my mental engagement to other projects. Was I shaken? Of course. But like when the rain falls, I knew that if I stood in a different place I might find myself dry and in the sun.</p>\n<p>A RISD critique shouldn&#8217;t be just a simulation of the rockiness of reality of course, and it should be thought of more as an immersive learning experience that supportively takes you from intellectual ground point A to point B. At the same time, it&#8217;s useful to consider that as you are taken from freshman year to graduating year, at some point it will probably be useful to dip in reality with a summer job as many of you students already do. Practical experience with real bruises is entirely useful; the complex world of commerce that surrounds is the greater context that serves as our emotionless judge/jury at all times <i>a la</i> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam Smith</a>.</p>\n<p>So, back to the topic, your wording of students as &#8220;target practice&#8221; lies at the heart of the real potential problem. In the setting of a school, when you submit yourself to someone else for criticism you are really trusting the other person to have mercy on you and to serve a role as a mentor/peer. The idea of having a course that teaches students how not only to take a critique (bad or good), but also to give one themselves (bad or good) is an extremely worthwhile concept.</p>\n<p>MIT has the equivalent of Wintersession called &#8220;Independent Activities Period.&#8221; Every year there is one of my favorite professors, Prof. Patrick Henry Winston giving a special lecture on &#8220;How to Give a Lecture.&#8221; Contrary to being 5% full for attendance it&#8217;s usually a packed audience. Harvard cleverly packaged Prof. Winston&#8217;s lecture up quite nicely <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58703/winston1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. It would be great if RISD had a &#8220;How to Give a Critique&#8221; equivalent available for the community here and also for the world community at large on video. Let&#8217;s continue the conversation here and see where this all goes. (It would be even more interesting perhaps to have a &#8220;How to Receive a Lecture&#8221; and/or &#8220;How to Receive a Critique&#8221; seminar.)</p>\n<p>And in the great tradition of RISDoids that I am deeply proud of, one of graciousness that I haven&#8217;t seen anywhere else, we must owe this discussion on critiques not to me but to Mr. Jeffrey Yan.</p>\n<p>-John\n</p><p/></div>",

Immediate impact: How does the work strike you visually?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;2.

There I learned about important things such as building codes, the staples order catalogue, and also the importance of an architect&#8217;s ability to work with many different people that are at times very difficult.</p>\n<p>I also learned about the importance of choosing the scale, details, and materials correctly in order to fit within a given budget.  I am eternally grateful that my school projects don&#8217;t get value engineered by my teachers to half the proposed size with cheaper materials.  I am able to work much more freely and creatively without the real-life constraint of budget.  In this case, the suspension of reality (budget) allows students&#8217; projects to be more creative and original and tackle deeper issues of architecture.  Similarly, I imagine some students would feel freer to experiment with the unknown if they never had to worry about the real-life threat of destructive or un-professional critiques.</p>\n<p>Reality cannot be suspended of course so I am comfortable accepting the rare bruising critique.  Something that truly concerns me though is that students may learn to act inappropriately in their own lives because they see such behavior condoned in the academic institution.  In response to abusive critiques I often encounter the attitude that the experience is a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221; that is to be passed down ceremoniously from generation to generation ad infinitum.  Insensitivity and harsh behavior becomes glorified and the recipients wear bruises as a badge of honor.  I saw the same attitude justify fraternity hazing my freshman year at another school, and I find this rational to immature yet frighteningly contagious. </p>\n<p>I hope when students experience the type of destructive critique that has been mentioned, they do learn.  I hope they learn to do better and not perpetuate such negativity systematically throughout their lives and the rest of the school.  I hope they come to pride themselves on being able to give helpful and constructive critiques, and not pride themselves on being able to verbally tear projects apart.  I wonder how we can learn about the tough realities of the real world and accept them, but not accept or allow them in our own behavior, and I wonder how this distinction is made.\n</p><p/></div>",

There were the people who the prof refused to crit because they hadn&#8217;t worked hard enough. There were the people who were ashamed of their work because they though they could do better. The work was almost always great, though. It was a loving critique, always, but with much vigor and competition. In contrast to my second semester:</p>\n<p>Victor Lara tought me the most valuable thing. Every crit with victor, we would talk about almost every drawing. He didn&#8217;t even mean to, but we would get so caught up in the beauties that he would find in the art through talking about it. After I left his class, I feel I can find beauty in anything. In a way this is almost anti-crit.

The attempt was to make it an entirely open event by having it real-time blogged. An alternative scenario would have been to webcast it &#8212; which although cool in concept, really couldn&#8217;t be done well without prohibitive cost &#8230; and furthermore it&#8217;s hard to feel comfortable with a video camera pointed at you unless you&#8217;re Beyonce. While I was at the event, I marveled at the skill with which <i>Two</i>&#8217;s constant gardener <b>Liz Leuthner</b> could take what was said, and then reduce it down to its simplest essence. Then towards the end of the day, we were getting signals back from RISD central that there was concern that what was posted did not make complete sense. And furthermore it became clear that, as <b>Liz O&#8217;Neil</b> points out, we weren&#8217;t able to get court-reporter-style transcription so the accuracy of what was written was not 99.99% spot-on to what the conversants were offering. Rather than let a great deed start more miscommunication, we took it down and stopped and began to think. <i>What were we missing?</i> The answer became simple. We were missing the context. And we were also missing the permission of the conversants to be blogged with their names attributed. And we were missing the opportunity to explain to the audience that everything written were snippets and could not be transcribed within the fuller context. <i>So we learned.</i></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next? Well, the plan is to, as Prof. <b>Lane Myer</b> and others <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/06/23/conversation-on-conversation\">have put it,</a> get a bit out of the trees and back out to the forest. A coarser summary of the day&#8217;s event will be presented within a week&#8217;s time if all goes well. Thanks for your patience and the great <i>open</i> conversation about how we can improve.</p>\n<p>And what was that event all about? It was about ideas of leadership, ideas of what an academic institution&#8217;s role might be today, and ideas about new technologies that seem to disrupt our daily lives without end. It was about how we can start to think together as a community. <i>It was a start.</i> And we plan to have more such events in the coming year. We&#8217;ve only just begun.</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>On the particularly relevant theme of &#8220;independence day&#8221; I reflected today on the implications of freedom. The freedom to communicate is a powerful thing. *Who* is doing the communicating will often make a difference. For that reason, blogs when they first emerged were interesting because they are were all in the first-person in everyone&#8217;s voice &#8212; instead of a single person&#8217;s or single group&#8217;s voice. The situation at the retreat would have been alleviated if every participant had their own personal blog. Taking down content on <i>Two</i> could happen, but everyone&#8217;s individual blog would have stayed intact. This reflection makes me realize that this is an institutional blog at best if we carry too much concern on who&#8217;s perspective matters more on this blog or even debate what is right or wrong to post.</p>\n<p>As I first began to approach my responsibilities as President a few months back, I drafted my <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/maedas-three-resolutions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">four resolutions</a>. In the matter of how the info from the offsite was taken off, I used: <i>3) Listen broadly, but don&#8217;t waffle on decisions.</i> The content came down as my decision upon hearing and seeing the potential issues. Now I am fortunate to consider: <i>4) When in error &#8212; admit, apologize, move forward.</i> In retrospect I can see that if the posts were kept up as is, then things would have been just fine and no major catastrophe would have occurred. So I apologize to the community for making an imperfect call. Especially to Ginnie and her staff as it must have been an uncomfortable surprise to go to <i>Two</i> only to find the content missing without a clear explanation &#8212; one did come but it was belated at best. Ginnie&#8217;s the master of an elegant, real-time on-stage recovery so I know she recovered just fine. And at the same time although I have regrets I also know that my decision has given a chance for our community to reflect upon the nature of this blog and how RISDoids want it to be. I hear that everyone wants it to feel <i>free</i> like is the theme of this day and also the theme of our country. What is obvious is only obvious when it is taken away. </p>\n<p>I am reminded of a conference that ran near MIT a few years back. The actual conference began to stall in content &#8230; and a few participants had setup a conference blog together, and it turns out that almost every participant was glued to their laptop conversing on the blog instead of paying attention to the conference lectures. As Zeke points out on the importance of talking in <i>any context,</i> I hope that this blog sparks other smaller conversations all over RISD that are not limited to <i>Two</i>. Take control of how you talk with each other on the things you love to discuss. As long as that conversation happens, this blog does not matter. <i>Two</i> is a place to try out ideas, experiment, fail, succeed. Thanks for trying it out. -John\n</p><p/></div>",

There&#8217;s recently a new vacant storefront that just opened up this year under the Mason building and to the left of the CIT entrance that would be just perfect for a new RISD eatery :). I say eatery because it is almost 1 in the morning over here in Paris and I am very tired and it is hard for me to think of something else that would allure people downtown to hang out during the day. It would be nice for the RISD community to branch out, mainly for us undergraduates who our fellow classmates have yet to venture into our studios or even know what exactly Interior Architecture does. And the cries of wanting food on the meal plan closer to us appear to be few since when asking around CIT, very few graduate students have a meal plan. Just a hint, doubtful anything can be done within the next year before I graduate but maybe for future hungry CIT dwellers like me.</p></div>",

On any given school day there are well over 20 things happening on and around campus, from student lead organizations to lectures by some of the worlds finest.</p>\n<p>The current new calendar is not setup for this type of schedule. As it is, the calendar shows a typical grid of days from a given month. The boxes then have the events for that day listed in them. Hovering over an event brings about a hovering window with slightly more information about the event.</p>\n<p>What happens when school starts and there are these 20+ events on a single day? Will the days list everyone of them out in that same box, or will it simply have a number of how many events are on that day. If the latter is the case is the case, when you hover over the day will it list the detailed information about these events, or will you need to click the day to see them al on another page?</p>\n<p>Simply put, this system of calendar is not in tune with a campus calendar. You can click on the list view, but then you no longer have the ability to select categories. Also, nothing is color coated. What if I only want to see sporting events? I have look for them my self, or go back to the grid. </p>\n<p>I believe the calendar needs to be something that I as a student can quickly go to and see what is happening right now, today. Or click a button and see only the events today (or an other day/ month if I select it) in that category.</p>\n<p>Student life here is hectic. I could never tell you if I have time tomorrow, but I can tell you right now. So show me a list of things happening in different categories now, before I ever click on anything.</p>\n<p>There is a reason that we have so many posters all over campus. The previous calendar failed to work they way we think, and we have a great opportunity here and now to fix it.\n</p><p/></div>",

This will be one of the most confusing pages.</p>\n<p>Granted I can click on a day view (click the date) and it fixes this kind of. But then I need to click on the event to read more about it. That is already 2 pages deep to read more info about the event.</p>\n<p>But even the hover over info makes it difficult to click on the right area, because it comes up without you wanting and it takes over the space. You then need to move the mouse out of the area to have it go away and then attempt to hover over the right event before you do to any others.</p>\n<p>On the day view, if things where color coded it would be great.</p>\n<p>The CMS on the calendar is also complex. Too much so. All the options on the left that have nothing to do with the calendar are confusing to the new user.</p>\n<p>Lots of options are great, but the more options the more time it takes to do something. The longer it takes to do something, the less likely people are to use it.</p>\n<p>Then there is the information architecture. It is well documented that better looking interfaces are perceived to be easier to use. I know this is just a CSS issue , but it is key.</p>\n<p>Im not just nip picking, I truly feel that the RISD calendar is one of the most, if not the most important things to have on the intranet.

I&#8217;ve spent countless hours trying to make the jolt&#8217;s events page be the most comprehensive collection of on/off campus events possible but find that even though it is free, takes 30 seconds and gets you free publicity people do not always input their events.

Also, the Jolt&#8217;s will hopefully be making the big jump to 2.0 this August and one of the new features is a bulletin board on which people can post flyers for their events in addition to adding them to the listing.

Legacy data formats can be thought of as the old bricks/piping in a creaky building that is being renovated in the greater context of a historic district where complete tear downs are not possible. New piping has come in with Ektron, but the new piping and the old piping have to mate with the previous building&#8217;s infrastructure. </p>\n<p>In an ideal re-design, legacy data components are considered for re-use as they are being done so now, and future data stores are built without a need to connect back to legacy components. In other words, new data can be formatted into more fresh and contemporary &#8220;bricks&#8221; for the newly renovated building eventually. And also in the future with more modern data stores it becomes possible to paint better &#8220;facades&#8221; (i.e. interfaces) around the data.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I just finished reading Prof. Clay Shirky&#8217;s new book <i>Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations</i>. It&#8217;s an excellent read and if you haven&#8217;t met Prof. Shirky of NYU yet, you&#8217;re in for a surprise and treat. One of many of Prof. Shirky&#8217;s points in his book are that in the age of the Internet, it&#8217;s impossible to imagine true centralization of knowledge and authority. On page 35 he writes, </p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe basic capabilities of tools like Flickr reverse the old order of group activity, transforming &#8220;gather, then share&#8221; into &#8220;share, then gather.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>His point on &#8220;share, then gather&#8221; is what I feel is the way that the world will move forward. In other words, it would be the 20th century ideal to have one single source of information at RISD. Where everyone somehow *had* to visit and contribute. That&#8217;s not &#8230; 21st century. And that&#8217;s not &#8230; American (sorry, it&#8217;s political season so I can&#8217;t help but feel patriotic &#8212; <smile>). That&#8217;s Clay&#8217;s &#8220;gather, then share.&#8221; Broadcast, instead of aggregate. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People have too many choices, and want to keep their choices on their own terms. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</smile></p>\n<p>So my answer to your question is that many forums at RISD should exist. Dailyjolt, intranet forums, etc. What needs to happen is for us to easily aggregate all the forums into a useful corpus of information. For instance: <i>Have a question about dormitory discussions?</i> There should be a way to aggregate all the littler forums at RISD into a single meta-one as easy as a Google search. <i>Want to contribute your new knowledge about how to use a kind of adhesive in relationship to metal?</i> Add it to your local club&#8217;s share, but when you access RISDpedia it can go reach out to all the info at RISD and simply generate a new link. </p>\n<p>Such technology does not exist yet, but it&#8217;s not rocket science. But if such technology were to exist, then everyone can operate at their own pace and within their own interests. And at the same time it becomes easy to aggregate and convene all the viewpoints together.</p>\n<p>Regarding the value of anonymous posting in forums, I believe that it does exist and thus here we experiment with &#8220;anonymous Two-sdays.&#8221; The panic button feature enables the reduction of social damage to RISD to the extent that is manageable &#8212; but I&#8217;m a firm believer that it&#8217;s impossible to &#8220;manage&#8221; or &#8220;control&#8221; anything really in this century. Rumors are fed by anonymous sources. The sooner that rumors can be reduced, the community can go on to doing what it is best at (versus expending enormous time trying to determine the validity of a rumor). </p>\n<p>At the same time, having a viewpoint in name is critical as part of being the citizen of a community. Thus real-name authentication is the best way to approach things. People are usually concerned of putting their name out there &#8212; it&#8217;s only natural as it takes a great deal of courage to do so. </p>\n<p>Public forums can easily diverge into &#8220;flame wars&#8221; &#8212; which can also be detrimental to an organization. Thus having this forum itself opens the possibility for such uncomfortable things to happen. In the event that there is a catastrophic conversation that occurs in this forum, even if it were to be shutdown it could migrate to another forum elsewhere. So it&#8217;s a risk that we live with, even if we imagine that we can somehow manage that risk. </p>\n<p>There are simple <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/anonymous-posting-guidelines/\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidelines</a> to this forum as an anonymous poster or a real-name one. I have my own in my life that I have posted <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/maedas-three-resolutions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Ideally we look for the positive, whenever possible. Criticism of a concept can always be constructive; criticism of a person or group however tends to be not. </p>\n<p>Prof. Jainschigg brought up an important comment in the Faculty thread that I read as &#8220;citizenship&#8221; &#8212; the basic binder of modern civilization and organizations. Being a good citizen is not easy. So for anyone reading this forum, I invite them to help co-define what it means to be a &#8220;citizen of RISD.&#8221; We can create, refine, edit, and embody the qualities we all feel represent the RISD citizen of the 21st century.\n</p><p/>\n<p/></div>",

Dailyjolt, intranet forums, etc. What needs to happen is for us to easily aggregate all the forums into a useful corpus of information. For instance: Have a question about dormitory discussions? There should be a way to aggregate all the littler forums at RISD into a single meta-one as easy as a Google search. Want to contribute your new knowledge about how to use a kind of adhesive in relationship to metal? Add it to your local club&#8217;s share, but when you access RISDpedia it can go reach out to all the info at RISD and simply generate a new link.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That sounds amazing and like technological/communal nirvana to some degree. But wouldn&#8217;t such a system (one that could wrangle up all the other systems into a larger database) become it&#8217;s own &#8220;single source of information&#8221;? I understand that it would be made up of and thrive on it&#8217;s parts but wouldn&#8217;t it essentially function like Digg or Fark just on a smaller scale and in an enclosed community environment?\n</p><p/></div>",

A special institution, the Providence Athenaeum, is also part of CHiL; due to the 10 years of sharing an online catalog, there is reciprocal borrowing for Athenaeum members at RISD, and for the RISD community at the Athenaeum.

Off the top of my head, 20 Wash has at least one, and Ewing house as well. We could also come up with some policies on usage? 10 minute time limit? Carry in carry out? clean up after yourself etc&#8230;. here are some bike to work recommendations <a href=\"http://www.bikemaine.org/btwemployer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the bicycle coalition of Main</a>, 31 ways to promote biking to work from the <a href=\"http://www.bicyclealliance.org/getinvolved/promote.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bicycle Alliance</a>.<br/>\nWith regards to the elevators on campus, 20 Wash is a public building, and the elevators are serving as key access points to upper offices. The basement however has no key access, yet I see young healthy folks using the elevator to go to and from the basement all the time. Perhaps some signs pointing out that if you are only going to/from 1st flr or basement, why not use the stairs? This would not only burns some calories, it&#8217;d save some electricity as well.\n</p><p/></div>",

To be honest, I don&#8217;t know when I would.  Half the time, I catch it with someone who&#8217;s going up to 3 and 4 anyway, while carrying furniture.</p>\n<p>Here is a small list of things we need to CONSIDER:</p>\n<p>CURRENT FITNESS CENTER SCHEDULES posted ONLINE (this includes updated hours on holidays)  none of this bullshit about-walking to the gym at 3pm to find a small sheet of paper on the door saying it&#8217;s holiday hours, and having to turn around.  This will allow all students assurance that the gym will be open when they want to work out.  RISD needs to be dependable for our undependable schedules.</p>\n<p>LESS RIDICULOUS HEALTH CENTER policy.  When I&#8217;m sick and throwing up (for example) I don&#8217;t want the secretary to ask if i have an appointment, and say we can&#8217;t see you today, what time are you free tomorrow?  I would say 80+% of risd students trips to the health center are not planned 24 hours in advance.  the other 20% are for free cough medicine and pain reliever. And the fact that they are our ONLY health facility, and they CLOSE for lunch and at 5:55p (because they all want to go home) is not playing into our favor as students, especially those who are sick on the WEEKEND. Hello! We are not a commuter school, that has students on campus m-f only.  WE ARE THE REASON to have a health center.  SERVE us. </p>\n<p>KEEPING HEALTHY OPTIONS IN THE DINING FACILITIES PAST 8 pm.<br/>\nI don&#8217;t know who sleeps earlier than Midnight, but for the rest of us who get hungry between 8pm and 1am, it would be nice to purchase something NOT FRIED.  </p>\n<p>The issues we are dealing with are the results of poor (i use this term lightly) Administration.  RISD needs to rethink its priorities and realize that the success of its students are dependent on the quality of their work (which is a result of great professors and great facilities and connections) and not about the expensive &#8220;new green building&#8221; that nobody really needs. </p>\n<p>Everyone is thinking of expanding and making more money and accepting more students, when really the quality of the students at that point is being sacrificed for, what I assume everyone sees, money  (in the form of international students).  If you can&#8217;t provide services for 40 more kids each year, STOP accepting them!  that&#8217;s it. its so easy.  Try to spend a little less each year (don&#8217;t give $5000 to each lounge in 15 West-maybe $500 would do). And maybe we can stabalize and up the quality more than quantity.  I don&#8217;t see the name RISD pulling as much weight these days as it did before.

All-caps and broad generalizations are usually a sign of feeling unheard, but the fact is that you are being heard. Thank you for bringing a student&#8217;s perspective to a discussion that had largely been directed at, and participated in, by the staff, a different (but also important) group of people RISD.  You point out well that students have very different needs that should of course be part of this discussion. </p>\n<p>To share with you my own observations thus far as a newcomer, RISD is a complex system running since 1877 with numerous incredible people passionately dedicated to all of the students, but even more importantly they are dedicated to what RISD stands for as embodied by our <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/07/07/the-mission-possible/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission</a>. What is the RISD we will leave for our ancestors, and theirs? This is the core question I will be asking with the community not just on this blog, but in our physical spaces around RISD as well when the fall term gets in motion.</p>\n<p>RISD is way bigger than any one of us. I am reminded of graduate Zeke Leonard&#8217;s recent speech at commencement, here is an excerpt from that rousing speech he gave:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI want to pause for just a moment and look at the Now.  Right now.  This moment here in this parking lot.  There is a tension in the air that is palpable, a humming taught string of potentiality that is binding us all together.  In this moment, everything is possible.  We have in our tool-boxes the ability to shatter boundaries and build bridges and make and think in ways that have not yet been seen or even conceived.</p>\n<p>We live in a world in which boundaries are constantly shifting.  Walls are being torn down as others are erected, paradigms are changing, expectations are constantly in flux.  All of this is happening faster and faster.  In order to process and react to this accelerating and ever-changing reality, a new way of thinking will be required, one that is curious, passionate, agile, non-linear, and creative.</p>\n<p>We have come to RISD because it offers an education that is unparalleled.  Skills training, yes.  Typesetting or weaving or woodworking, sure.  And design training as well, of course.  We have all become more proficient at finding design solutions and making strong bold statements through our work.  But what is most important, what is at the heart of what RISD offers, is an openness to this new way of thinking.  And we have an even greater gift and responsibility:  To not just be open to this way of thinking, but to invent it and to act on it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I thank you and everyone else for coming to two.risd to voice their concerns, hopes, challenges for the future of RISD. This blog won&#8217;t be the only place where we begin to embody a culture of critical thinking about our own organization &#8212; but it&#8217;s a starting point to work together on the challenges we face ahead. See you all at a future jog, meditation, cafe, or out and about on campus**. </p>\n<p>-John (** PS I am usually running or fast-walking between appointments around campus and like to be on time so stopping to chat is usually not an option &#8212; but if I appear unattached in an existing conversation and you can run/walk with me between points I&#8217;m always here to lend an ear.)\n</p><p/></div>",

There will be a two-day &#8220;Office Supply Exchange&#8221; on August 20 + 21 in BEB 106. <em>Thanks in advance to all who participate (volunteers are welcome!). Here&#8217;s the full scoop, below, from Kathy. </em></p>\n<p>_______________</p>\n<p>Hi Folks,</p>\n<p>Denise Simokin and I have identified a problem. Many offices seem to have an assortment of unused office supplies.</p>\n<p>This seems to be the result of changes in personnel. One staff person prefers a particular type of pen. One supervisor prefers some other type of file folder. Staff members and supervisors change. The new people want to use different products and supplies.</p>\n<p>The result is an accumulation of supplies. New people purchase the supplies they like. The old items sit in the supply closet.</p>\n<p>We would like to schedule an Office Supply Exchange or &#8220;2nd Life for Office Supplies&#8221;. You are invited to send materials from your supply closet that you don&#8217;t use. We will collect these from across campus and put them in one location. You can then go through and find any items that you do use and take them with you.</p>\n<p>If you have too many items to carry, we will enlist the help of Facilities to move things. We are going to deal with general office supplies.  We are not including large furniture items at this time.</p>\n<p>We will attempt to find a location to store the remaining materials. We will provide more details as they become available.</p>\n<p>The Office Supply Exchange will be held on August 20 &amp; 21. The day after the event all materials will be removed. This will be held in BEB 106. As many people are moving before then, we have identified a spot in the BEB where supplies can be sent now and will be moved into 106 for the days of the exchange. Please contact me to arrange for the drop off of those materials.</p>\n<p>We are open to ideas and suggestions so please let us know what you think. We will also need people to staff BEB 106 during these days. If you can spend an hour or two helping, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>Kathy</p></div>",

A few months ago, Phil Oliveira from Residence Life showed me a video of the Collab competition and parade.</p>\n<p>In decades past, the ID and Architecture departments would split into teams consisting of people of both majors and do an on-site building project at the RISD farm, and almost the entire school turned out to watch. It was sort of a carnival day, with the competition going on at the same time as a cookout and games. Stemming off from that, the students started a tradition of parading around Providence in RISD-style chaos, blaring boomboxes, playing any number of instruments, wearing crazy costumes, ect.</p>\n<p>I would like to try to bring Collab, or something like it, back to RISD. I feel like RISD has such a wonderful spirit, but there&#8217;s just not enough time or opportunity to express it as much as we&#8217;d like. Are there any people out there who remember Collab? If we were to bring it back, how could we make it a successful, vital part of what RISD is?</p>\n<p>Steph</p></div>",

Yet I was even more surprised to see strong parallels to our own I.D. Department such as an extensive machine shop, C.A.D. programs like SolidWorks and Rhinoceros, and even a rigorous drawing course. It seems both departments could benefit greatly by working together, and from talking to various students and professors on both ends, they are eager to take advantage of this opportunity.

        "content": "<div><p>A trio of students presented me with some questions recently about education, to which I respond to in this space:</p>\n<p><i>1/ In what ways can new technologies (multi-touch screens, digital boards, virtual learning environments, tangible media devices) enhance the learning and educational experience at RISD, a school which seems to have a more traditional background where technologies may not have been highly integrated into its infrastructure.</i> Well, it&#8217;s a question of whether new technologies change the attitudes of the learners in the classroom more than anything else. Can you learn more by using new technologies? For sure you can learn differently, and I&#8217;m sure there is research out there that can &#8220;prove&#8221; you learn better with new technologies, but I believe that we live in an age where if you want to know something, you can just Google it from your mobile phone while you&#8217;re sipping a latte somewhere on any campus in the world. You don&#8217;t even have to be on campus &#8212; you could be at a rock concert and &#8220;learn&#8221; how to do something off the Web from your mobile. My point is that technology is everywhere now and will be with you forever. So it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have places where technology isn&#8217;t. To illustrate the point, one of my best friends is a professor at an East Coast university who one day got fed up with students SMS-ing to people outside his classroom and during lecture opened up a video chat window directly to me. I answered the video connection and asked what my friend what he was doing. He said, &#8220;Oooooh, nothing much. Just giving lecture in class &#8230;&#8221; (smile). Finally, there is the all too common situation of having a professor walk into a superbly wired classroom with state-of-the-art this-that only to find that they can&#8217;t get the projector to sync and for their wireless network to work so that the entire class is spent as a tech-support nightmare. So in short, I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s a real simple answer here. A SmartBoard in every classroom/studio will not necessarily make RISD a better educational institution. Nor will everyone convening in Second Life. The answers will take a while to develop, and it is the good questions that will drive how we find a solution together. So, discuss away.</p>\n<p><i>2/ In your opinion, are there any aspects of learning and education that new technologies can enhance?</i> I believe that the majority of opportunities with new technologies might exist in opportunities for learning outside the classroom, and also for learning before you come to RISD and afterwards as well. RISD is a physical institution that everyone comes to for convening in corporeal form. There are not many advancements in using technology in the physical world in a reliable form &#8212; RFID tags are still not 100% foolproof for use in experience design (witness the ambitious but unsuccessful IDEO Prada retail space project), Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Computing initiative is more of a marketing push than a real system that everyone will use in the next 2 to 3 years (note how it uses a projector &#8212; high energy inefficiency &#8212; as well as the tracking technology is still imperfect), and so forth. But better technologies will come, and it&#8217;s useful to think about what they should do (versus to be driven by waiting for them to come to us instead). </p>\n<p><i>3/ Do you happen to have any specific technologies in mind that you believe will be beneficial to an educational institution, such as RISD?</i> Yes. I believe that anything that helps RISD envision the future ten to twenty years out will be advantageous to students as they are the ones that will shape the future; it&#8217;s important that students have a sense of what it will look like. So in a &#8220;research&#8221; sense of the word versus everyday learning in an educational environment, I feel that having first-peek access to what is coming is a useful opportunity to evaluate, critique, predict, and remake the future. For instance I am currently working to try and secure one of <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/02/28/ilene-chaiken-speaking-g-speak/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these</a> for RISD. </p>\n<p>Please feel free to add your own take.\n</p><p/></div>",

We learn to work with our hands in the metal and wood shops first so when designing on the computer I know what that material will look like, how it will feel, and if it will work.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I&#8217;m not sure I answered the question though. Oh well.\n</p><p/></div>",

I came by the use of that room rather incidentally, when I asked for an office. (!)</p>\n<p>When I learned where I was assigned, I was sort of shocked but quickly aware of the possibility of using it as a community quiet space. So I just did it. I was encouraged by the general interest and support it got. Students just got right into it.</p>\n<p>Now, that room is needed for faculty offices, very understandably. But because this came about sort of by happenstance, I am not sure whether it would have enough community support to try to get it into the college&#8217;s priority list for a small, central space somewhere in the midst of all these office moves. I know space is so precious. That I do know.</p>\n<p>What I would like to know is what role silence, or quiet plays in the creative process? What value is there in a place low on external stimulation, set aside for reflection? I would appreciate any thoughts.</p></div>",

I found this wonderful to make that sort of quiet time for myself 3 mornings a week, and I wish I had commited myself to doing it even more often than that.<br/>\nOne of the really valuable aspects of that experience for me, though, was being able to engage with a larger community of people who were committed to that quiet time the way I was&#8211; People who were serious and respectful of that opportunity. I know that sort of community is not at all necessary to the singularity of meditation, but I wish RISD could orchestrate a similar weekly/daily event. I believe that the professor from Brown runs those meditations on a daily basis, but the space is quite a hike to get to, especially early in the morning from the bottom of college hill.\n</p><p/></div>",

It&#8217;s not really silence, of course, just quiet / attention / awareness / relative stillness / immersion in time.  </p>\n<p>I liked the exchange between Barack Obama &amp; David Cameron on the priority of scheduling large blocks of time every day just for thinking.

The  worst thing this school ever did is to subscribe to the &#8220;always on&#8221; mode of interaction among its administrative staff.  When I check my email at midnight, there are late night messages from my colleagues;  there is an expectation that there will be a response by start of business the next day.  And that start of business time isn&#8217;t 8:30 any more.  No one is on vacation in this modern and enllightened era, or really &#8220;out of the office&#8221;.  The queeping and yelping of cellphones and computers are much more annoying and distracting than the sirens and car horns on College Street ever were.  I don&#8217;t think we are more productive with all this instant and constant access and conductivity.

While I agree with folks that quiet can be a state of mind, I have never lived/worked somewhere where I find cultivating such calm to be so very difficult.    </p>\n<p>I see my colleagues and my students always running about, overscheduled, so that when I do have the rare chance to sit down for lunch, or have an extended conversation with a student about work, it feels like a luxury.  As Sheila&#8217;s comment about being &#8220;always on&#8221; demonstrates, this kind of overload extends to staff as well. </p>\n<p>I think some of this overload stems from structures and practices that have become embedded as the RISD way.  Another factor is, I hate to say, the proliferation of digital media.  I understand fully all the benefits that come with electronic media, but I think it would be really useful for the RISD community to have a conversation about the ways in which these forms of communication impact work/life balance.</p>\n<p>I know there are corporations who have instituted email-free Fridays and while this might not be the right direction for RISD, measures of this sort highlight the ways in which many folks feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they are supposed to instantaneously process.  </p>\n<p>To return to contemplation, then, and to connect these comments with the thread about health/wellness at RISD&#8212;I think cultivating an institutional culture where unstructured time and the reflection it makes possible is valued and institutionally supported (and where it&#8217;s ok *not* to answer your email at midnight) will help us maintain wellness at both the individual and collective levels.\n</p><p/></div>",

The term &#8216;actual size interfaces&#8217; has been on my mind. I define this as digital devices that can be interacted with just like physical objects. Touch screens are chiefly what I&#8217;m imagining. It would be nice to see an interface as an extension of the surroundings. </p>\n<p>Another realization that came out of this week with Kyle was that Web sites are denser than ever. What have sites done the recent luxuries of larger screens and higher bandwidth? They&#8217;ve added more navigation, more tabs, and smaller text. The need to show me everything makes me want nothing. I&#8217;d rather stumble across information than have it be overly categorized.  </p>\n<p>E15 is visionary in its spacial layout, but as much so because it doesn&#8217;t treat the user like he&#8217;s/she&#8217;s stupid. Through its lack of instruction, it encourages play and exploration. When users invest in what&#8217;s in front of them, they remember more.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Kyle for conjuring up these thoughts.

I like what he did with the iPhone because it situates a Wiimote-like experience im an everyday object (mobile phone). For about 10 years I owned a Polhemus (3d tracking system) but never got around to using it because everything on the computer is designed for three constraints: flatness of display space, alphanumeric input, and a single user at-a-time. </p>\n<p>It is interesting that videogame consoles have solved all these problems &#8212; I find it interesting that in elementary schools without much money (which is sadly most of them) have 4 kids huddled around one computer and fightimg over one keyboard and mouse; meanwhile you can connect 4 independent controllers to a Playstation. Today&#8217;s personal computer is much like a motorcycle &#8212; meant for only one rider. Is that an issue? I&#8217;m not sure, but it is a thought.</p>\n<p>I know that Prof Fritz Drury teaches a course at Brown using their Cave. I&#8217;m interested in hearing amy students&#8217; firsthand experiences with it. FYI a &#8220;Cave&#8221; is a room that is instrumented with image projectors on all walls and 3d sensors that can detect your position and motion (usually using the Polhemus).\n</p><p/></div>",

Norberto, a proud native of Bergamo, Italy, was a recognized scholar of Venetian and Lombard Renaissance art, an authority on the Renaissance painter Lorenzo Lotto, and an inspiring teacher of hundreds of students at RISD since 1995. A reception in his honor will take place on the afternoon of September 20 in The RISD Museum. Details will be announced closer to the date. Norberto will be greatly missed by the many people who knew him and by those who often heard him whistling as he walked down College Hill.</p></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>Hi Faculty, Staff, and Students, </p>\n<p>Some of you may recall that there was an inconclusive conversation begun with the city of Charlotte last year, and that I reported on <i>One.risd.edu</i> that I had begun to pick up the ball from where it lay on the field as part of the presidential transition. I published the letter I wrote to the representatives of Charlotte on <i>One</i> and it is still <a href=\"http://one.risd.edu/index.php/risd-charlotte-new/\">here</a>. Comments on <i>One</i> from the RISD community were quite clear &#8212; that there was no real groundswell of interest in building a Charlotte campus of RISD. I heard the message loud and clear.</p>\n<p>As many of you who have met me are probably aware, I have absolutely no machinations for global expansion of the RISD campus as a network of satellite facilities. I believe that such an approach is very &#8220;20th century&#8221;-ish, and RISD can certainly take a more &#8220;21st century&#8221;-ish approach to connecting with the people of the world. RISD is in a position to invent brand new paradigms that have not yet been invented &#8212; if we do anything in this world we should constantly define &#8220;the RISD way&#8221; by our collective actions as a risk-taking culture that dares to be different. </p>\n<p>In short, last week visitors from Charlotte came to campus and were impressed with the RISD learning environment, and we made every effort to make it clear to the visitors that as an incoming President I have no immediate intention to set forth a plan for establishing a RISD campus in Charlotte. If there were a large contingency of Faculty and Students that wanted this to happen, then I would of course work with everyone here to do my best to make it so &#8212; but I don&#8217;t see that kind of interest right now in the cards. </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concern about the Charlotte matter please do comment. And before you do so, please catch up on your reading in the previous community blo, <i>One.risd.edu,</i> as many points have already been raised and heard regarding the Charlotte question. I am keeping this electronic forum as open and direct as possible &#8212; in return I ask that you do your best to keep a core notion that, &#8220;What&#8217;s said in two.risd, stays in two.risd&#8221; &#8230; but in the age of the Internet I know that&#8217;s somewhat difficult. I believe that a strong community is built upon facts, and not rumors. Rumors go away when communication channels are strong and open. I will do my best to continue to keep an open line of communication to the RISD community as we move forward. </p>\n<p>Enjoy the better weather,<br/>\nJohn</p></div>",

In light of John&#8217;s comments on the blog and elsewhere, we believe a project to which all can contribute reflects best the ethos of community-building and community-celebration at RISD.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/flags_sample2.gif\" alt=\"Inauguration flag\" align=\"left\"/><br/>\nAll staff, faculty, administrators, current students and incoming students will receive a 15&#8221; x 15&#8221; square of cloth to be decorated. These individual cloth squares will be attached to ribbons in order to create banners for exhibition at the inauguration&#8211;with some on display for the ceremonies in the First Baptist Church of America and others displayed in Market Square during the Block Party and possibly elsewhere on campus. In case you&#8217;re having trouble imagining what to do with your square, here are a few samples and hints:</p>\n<p>&#8226;   needlework<br/>\n&#8226;   quilting<br/>\n&#8226;   drawn, painted, or written text or images<br/>\n&#8226;   screenprint<br/>\n&#8226;   origami<br/>\n&#8226;   appliqu&#233;</p>\n<p>You may sign your square or submit it anonymously.  We hope that this project will be widely and vibrantly representative of the entire community.</p>\n<p>We ask that you please decorate your square in whatever manner you see fit and return it by Friday August 29, 2008, to the following address: Cecile Theroux, Office of Student Affairs, RISD, Two College Street, Providence, RI 02903. For those dropping their squares off in person or sending them via inter-office mail, please deliver them to Room #200 or #204 of the College Building.</p>\n<p>Please note that the cloth squares that are submitted will become the property of RISD and will not be returned. However, you will continue to own any intellectual property rights in your square and may exercise those rights as you wish. By making a submission, you are granting RISD only the physical ownership of the object and the nonexclusive right to make use of it (or photographic or similar representational reproductions of it) for RISD&#8217;s noncommercial educational and promotional purposes.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to return your square in person or by mail, please bring it with you to the Inauguration. Someone will be on hand to collect it.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this project, please contact Pat Brown (pbrown*AT*risd.edu) in the Division of Communications + Design.</p></div>",

Special thanks are due to <b>Kelly Morra</b> and her team for managing a move during what is the busiest season &#8212; preparing for our organization&#8217;s audit. </p>\n<p><i>There has been art in my life.</i> The above artwork on my office wall was left by <a href=\"http://risd.dailyjolt.com/profiles/index.html?who=aperryz\">aperryz</a> as an improved extension on a thought I once had years ago about life in general.</p>\n<p><i>There has been much love expressed for RISD.</i> Many alums have described to me the transformative power of a RISD education, and they have expressed strong feelings that I have come to the right institution at the right time. Given my daily excitement for the world of RISD I do agree wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p><i>There have been funny moments.</i> For instance, today I learned of a new rumor that &#8220;by direct order of the president&#8221; certain toilets now have new conserved-flushing mechanisms. (Uh, this is <i>not</i> true at all but I do applaud the rumor mill for its sense of humor.) </p>\n<p><i>There is much work to do.</i> The majority of my time is spent listening to open issues at RISD from every possible direction, listening to the world to see what challenges may lay ahead for our next generation of RISD graduates, and developing a stronger sense of teamwork among everyone on the RISD team. </p>\n<p>I continue to stay in contact with the posts on <i>Two</i> on a daily basis, and also engage outreach efforts to alums, parents, and many more fans of RISD on <i>Our</i>, by telephone, and/or in person. Thank you for continuing to participate in this uniquely <i>open</i> conversation here online, and we will be sure to host non-online gatherings to keep the communication flowing for non-online-ers come the fall.</p>\n<p>Best regards, John</p></div>",

I graduated from RISD this past May and I am currently working full time for Production at PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). When I entered RISD as a freshman, I never would have guessed that I would be here when I graduated. However, I&#8217;ve become enthusiastic about the work (there&#8217;s a lot of it!) and I intend to stay.</p>\n<p>PETA&#8217;s messages have become broader, and even more relevant as the truth about human impact on the environment is being exposed. The urgency of finding a solution to global warming has strengthened our &#8220;Meat Isn&#8217;t Green&#8221; campaign. It presents the fact that the meat industry is causing incredible devastation to the environment and immensely fueling the world&#8217;s food crisis (see [<a href=\"http://www.goveg.com/environment.asp%20for%20some%20compelling%20info\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a>]). With the addition of several &#8216;green design&#8217; classes at RISD, and the highly attended lecture given by vegan raw-foods expert David Wolfe, I thought that it would be beneficial (not to mention, highly entertaining) if Dan Mathews of PETA could give a talk at the RISD auditorium.</p>\n<p>Dan Mathews is PETA&#8217;s famously creative senior VP. He has recently been touring and promoting his book, &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/feat-committed.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Committed: A Rabble Rouser&#8217;s Memoirs</a>&#8217;, a collection of his amusing adventures and history with PETA. Dan is primarily responsible for making PETA a media magnet, and drawing its millions of members with inventive and artistic demonstrations. His ideas sparked PETA&#8217;s most successful (and most provocative) ad campaign, &#8220;I&#8217;d Rather Go Naked than Wear Fur.&#8221;  In a society constantly bombarded by advertising, it takes a great deal of ingenuity to grab the public&#8217;s attention and change their personal beliefs. But Dan Mathews has done just that. His insights and experience would be very helpful to RISD students whose careers will require them to do the same.</p>\n<p>I was not sure who to send this query to, so I thought I would first attempt to post it here. Please let me know before posting if there is someone I can contact directly. I look forward to your responses. Thank you for your time! <em>[Ed: I asked around and got some suggestions and advice, but decided to go ahead and make this post. Alison &#8212; I hope you get some good feedback.]</em></p></div>",

On the current site, the galleries of student work in each department are sparse and not updated regularly. The collaboration that occurs between faculty and students is such a crucial part of the RISD experience, it seems like we need to start visually demonstrating this more on the website.</p>\n<p>It would be great to see individual pages that faculty can login to and update themselves with information regarding their teaching and research. Many college and university websites today provide substantial information regarding their faculty in this manner. Currently, the RISD website lists only degrees and email for all faculty; a few faculty have images, but it&#8217;s inconsistent who does. One college website I visited recently even had a page for their students and faculty who blog. This provided another point of view of the school which is valuable for both prospective students and the school community as well.</p></div>",

However, more often than not I&#8217;ll stumble upon them by happenstance, rather than being able to just click on a videos button and access them all. Now I know this does not apply to the, i guess you would call them, &#8220;Alumni&#8221; videos that are posted on the front page. These are perfectly fine, but when I know that these videos can be executed so well, it makes me frustrated when I found out that there are more and not knowing where to necessarily go to see them. Just a simple function like this site&#8217;s, a filter that displays all videos in one channel regardless of context, that can be viewed in a scroll down list would be great. Please note that the only reason I have become frustrated is due to my true enjoyment and excitement when viewing the videos on the RISD.edu site.</p>\n<p>The only other complaint/request I have is for more views of the dorms. I had applied to PSU before being accepted at RISD (weird contrast of schools, i know) and when dealing with the task of displaying their dorm rooms, they took a 360 degree shot from the middle of the room, and in quicktime the viewer cans spin the camera and see every angle of the room. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say that risd needs this, but anything to give a better idea of what the dorms, or apartments for 15 west, or Houses look like.

Becoming a member of the RISD faculty 6 years ago meant dropping off the map as far as my &#8220;day job&#8221; is concerned.  As a member of the faculty of Liberal Arts this has been frustrating because the expectation is that a faculty member employed by a university or college will be readily accessible through the institution&#8217;s website in terms of contact information, CV, courses taught, news, etc.  Virtually all universities, regardless of tier, have comprehensive information about academic programs, departments, &amp; faculty linked to their home pages.  </p>\n<p>I think art &amp; design schools are, in general, a bit behind the curve in this respect.  The reasons for this might make an interesting research paper.   Again from my point of view as a writer/scholar, I kind of expect art &amp; design schools to be way *ahead* of the curve in terms of presentation of information, &amp; the Web, &amp; I confess that the situation has maddened me in the past.  But I&#8217;m trying to take the long (historical!) view &amp; also take note of the current pace of change &amp; the promise of improvements to come,  </p>\n<p>RISD, of course, should lead the pack.  The days when a spotlight on the &#8220;academic program&#8221; was best avoided are long over.  We have a fantastic academic program  &amp; a fantastic faculty.  I&#8217;m hopeful that comprehensive information about both will be publicly accessible before long.  </p>\n<p>I am speaking as a member of the faculty &#8212; but I also support Anonymous&#8217;s call for student visibility: that would really be putting RISD ahead of most curves.\n</p><p/></div>",

You can hear this in general in academic circles today so its definitely not just limited to RISD. And I recall when I was an undergrad that there was a general sense of corporatizing of MIT back in the day so it&#8217;s been ongoing forever. Post WWII, universities/colleges were all smaller &#8220;mom and pop&#8221; shops that have grown into what they are today. </p>\n<p>One of the many reasons I&#8217;ve chosen to accept the post as president of RISD is to find a way for academia to be true to its values of education, and not to become just a simple &#8220;average cold corporation.&#8221; Though I assure you that Google is about as cold a corporation as it gets. Yes they have free gourmet food and iguanas can come to work every day, but the focus is solely on increasing shareholder value. Instead at RISD we are living in a non-profit world where the goal is solely to uphold the organization&#8217;s <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/07/07/the-mission-possible/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission</a>.  We all here believe in the mission, and seek to protect the organization&#8217;s mission as the world turns. </p>\n<p>In my initial months here I&#8217;ve been impressed with the passion our HR department has for every person here at RISD &#8212; there is an ethos of achieving fairness to all RISDoids that is evident in every thoughtful act. I hear at least once every week from our HR folks the phrase, &#8220;Are we being fair and equitable?&#8221; This is the rubric used for all policy advancements on their part &#8212; and yes indeed is based upon broad conversations and expressions of concern by many. When we say in general to our kids that, &#8220;Life isn&#8217;t fair&#8221; I&#8217;d like to add that our HR department actually *does* bring us closer to what is fair. It&#8217;s a neat thing, and an important aspect of why I am proud to be a RISDoid. </p>\n<p>So, we are only as good as we can talk about ourselves in an open and honest fashion. Thanks to everyone for submitting your thoughts anonymously or in realname. As your president I can&#8217;t make everything perfect for every single constituent on/off campus, but I am a fairly good listener so keep your thoughts flowing. </p>\n<p>Online this space or offline near the water cooler, let&#8217;s apply the famous RISDoid <b>critical thinking</b> chops to our own environment and collectively engage the challenge of thinking about RISD together. The more minds the merrier. </p>\n<p>Regards, John\n</p><p/></div>",

John has a great point in that &#8220;some of the best design at RISD is driven by fine art-thinking, and some of the best fine art here is driven by design-thinking&#8221;. This is a good beginning in a healthy effort to conceive of the relationships between these two means of understanding our world. Art doesn&#8217;t just strive to question and ponder&#8230;but to express and discuss. What better platform for proposing a view and a possible solution? Designers set out to often &#8220;solve&#8221;, but a huge conflict that many an emerging designer faces is the notion of being absorbed into a corporate or educational machine where they are assigned parameters. Is the best solution for the individual always the cost effective one of the manufacturer? Case in point: we are prone to often say &#8220;good design&#8221;, what about &#8220;good art&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Maybe design assumes to be the authority on what we all need and art on what we want. To quell the debate in my mind on these issues I often think of a quote I picked up when I was young:</p>\n<p>&#8221; The supreme misfortune is when theory outstrips performance. &#8221;<br/>\n                                                                          -Leonard DaVinci\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>TRYING TO THINK ABOUT DESIGN &amp; POETRY</p>\n<p>Function/Intent:<br/>\nThe function of poetry is to carry the strong &amp; frail human voice through time.  Poetry explores the space between public &amp; private discourse; the nexus between thought &amp; language.  Its achievement is opening new forms of conversation between individuals at any point in time or space.</p>\n<p>You can use it at weddings, funerals, public &amp; private ceremonies of many kinds, on birthdays and Valentine&#8217;s Day. When you say, &#8220;Words fail,&#8221; you may find, actually they don&#8217;t.  </p>\n<p>You can lay in a stock of poems by buying or transcribing them.  You can also write them yourself.  This gives you a kind of script-in-advance, as well as broadening your capacity for linguistic observation &amp; expression in a day-to-day context.</p>\n<p>Poetry is very useful for making people laugh, having fun with language, giving your tongue a good work out (as good as, if not better than, French kissing or nougat), and prototyping outrageous inventions for future development.</p>\n<p>Fabrication / Production:<br/>\nPoetry is an art form which makes the conceptual material at the lowest possible cost. </p>\n<p>There are many cheap, if not free, technologies for its fabrication &amp; production.  No sophisticated tools or machinery are necessary.  </p>\n<p>A poem is produced by inscribing a surface in a way apprehensible to the human senses or imagination.   You can write with a pen on paper.  With a nail on a Styrofoam cup.  With blood on skin.  With air on air.  In white font in a white Word file.  In memory.  Is memory the instrument of inscription or the surface?   Tricky question.  Every transaction between instrument &amp; receptor is tricky.</p>\n<p>Poets love paper but they are very happy in digital environments too.  They are also happy whispering into a listening ear.</p>\n<p>New poems are distributed by love.  Only people who love poetry publish new poems.  </p>\n<p>Responsibility / Social Dimension:<br/>\nMahatma Gandhi wrote poetry.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, wrote powerful poetry.  Vaclav Havel was a poet. Even Che Guevara wrote poetry.  Aung San Suu Kyi writes poetry.  Cory Aquino paints, which is a form of poetry.  President Mary Robinson, in my own country, was not a poet, as far as I know.  She paid her deep attention to language as a constitutional lawyer.  And she kept poets close.  I don&#8217;t know if George Bush writes poetry but I would prefer if he did.</p>\n<p>Poetry has an immense effect on culture because poets are musicians &amp; musicians are poets &amp; poets are painters &amp; painters are poets &amp; poets are sculptors &amp; sculptors are poets &amp; poets are designers &amp; designers are poets &amp; poets are architects &amp; architects are poets &amp; poets are politicians &amp; politicians are poets &amp; poets are teachers &amp; teachers are poets &amp; poets are scientists &amp; scientists are poets &amp; poets are mathematicians &amp; mathematicians are poets &amp; poets are mothers &amp; fathers  &amp; mothers &amp; fathers are poets &amp; poets are poets too.  You get the idea.</p>\n<p>Sometimes poets move very quietly or ecstatically through the environment, drunk on cloud formations or galvanized by star clusters on cracked ice in an outhouse.   Sometimes they pick garbage off highways.  They organize.  They vote. </p>\n<p>Marketability / Business:<br/>\nPoetry likes &#8220;even better.&#8221;  Poetry disrupts the market by giving itself away.  It is the mystery in the market.  The question market.  </p>\n<p>If art raises questions, as Adam says, and design answers them, poetry does both, elegantly in a compact space.  Witness any sonnet by William Shakespeare.</p>\n<p>Poetry is a strange art form in that the producer &amp; the consumer are the same.  Only poets buy poetry &amp; all people who buy poetry are poets.  There is no other choice. Of course, &#8220;buy&#8221; may be variously defined.</p>\n<p>There is almost no demand for poetry but it comes anyway.  Environments where there is no poetry are soul-destroying.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much profit in it, except euphoria &amp; communion, but when the commodity runs out, the loss is severe.</p>\n<p>Another way in which the poetry economy is unusual is that it is one-on-one.  Poetry proceeds consciously, one-at-a-time, each encounter being fully satisfying.  The appetite is always for the one, rather than the many: one poem at a time, one &#8220;buyer&#8221; at a time too.</p>\n<p>Aesthetics &amp; Ergonomics:<br/>\nPoetry makes you feel 10 feet tall &amp; ready to stride across the ocean.  Poetry puts a giant spring in your step.  It can also add a bit of spark to conversations with friends.  For example, you can say (when mulling over a depressing experience):</p>\n<p>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,<br/>\nThe dark threw patches down upon me also;\t </p>\n<p>Or (walking on Blackstone Boulevard):</p>\n<p>what lovely behaviour<br/>\n  \tOf silk-sack clouds!</p>\n<p>Or (alone):<br/>\n                               \t\t             if<br/>\nI ever get to be a construction worker<br/>\nI&#8217;d like to have a silver hat please</p>\n<p>Or (with someone):</p>\n<p>we just want to be rich<br/>\nand walk on girders in our silver hats</p>\n<p>Poetry is always trying to get you to run away, when you&#8217;re trying to think about design.</p>\n<p>Thought tries to get you to stay.  Think.  Think.  Think about the experience of others.  What it is to read.  What it is to live in the buildings you design.  What is the range of your work?  What is the effect of what you do?</p>\n<p>I find it hard to think.  I prefer to have a great time with my materials.  Or to puzzle out questions of form.  My own division, Liberal Arts, reminds me to think about a broad range of human experience and culture, and the history of thinking in many disciplines.  It is a reality check, a possibility release.  One of the most stimulating things you can do is change your audience.</p>\n<p>I believe that, with all the gifts of talent, all the practice of skills, all the acquisition of knowledge, the most valuable innovation is the product of thought: deep, still, the pure gold of creativity.</p>\n<p>Design in poetry<br/>\nWriting poetry is like working in a heavenly deli.  You are making decisions constantly.  How thick?  How thin?   Daring yourself&#8212;I can slice it thinner, I know I can&#8230;. even thinner&#8230; thinner&#8230;.  And those marvelous smells!   The packaging is so excellent that it is the content too.  Poetry is sort of a bacon that rolls up into its own plush carrier bag.</p>\n<p>How about John&#8217;s 5 arrows trapped in a pentagon?  In poetry, exquisite darts are bungees.  Patrick Kavanagh called it, &#8220;playing a true note on a slack string.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Keats, writing to his brothers when he was 22, described Negative Capability: &#8220;that is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason.&#8221;  In less than a sentence, he articulated a powerful concept.</p>\n<p>Emily Dickinson wrote, &#8220;Tell all the truth but tell it slant.&#8221;  Poets are very literal creatures but know &amp; love language well enough to know not to read or write literally.</p>\n<p>Consider the 5 divisions of RISD.  They are rhetorical rather than definitive, institutionalized rather than expedient, fuzzy rather than bounded.  We could describe the place differently tomorrow if we chose to make it a priority.  </p>\n<p>No Division has a monopoly on Art or Design.  No Division has a monopoly on Thought.</p>\n<p>We could re-frame ourselves:  The Multiplication of Art; The Multiplication of Design; The Addition of Work; The Extension of Adventure; The Seed Head of Thought.  I have long wanted my own department to be called The Department of Fun.</p>\n<p>Even now I&#8217;m writing about thinking rather than actually thinking. George Carlin knows when to stop:</p>\n<p>The American Bu$ineSSman&#8217;s Ten Steps to Product Development</p>\n<p>1.\tCan I cut corners in the design?</p>\n<p>2.\tCan it be shoddily built?</p>\n<p>3.\tCan I use cheap materials?</p>\n<p>4.\tWill it create hazards for my workers?</p>\n<p>5.\tWill it harm the environment?</p>\n<p>6.\tCan I evade the safety laws?</p>\n<p>7.\tWill children die from it?</p>\n<p>8.\tCan I overprice it?</p>\n<p>9.\tCan it be falsely advertised?</p>\n<p>10.\t Will it force smaller competitors out of business?</p>\n<p>Excellent.

Additionally, it is unfortunate that recent alum are not granted access to resources such as computer workstations for at least the first year after graduating to assist with the transition into professional life.

I agree that &#8220;green talk&#8221; doesn&#8217;t cut the mustard; so there needs to be some practice to back up the ideas. In our <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/green-risd-beta-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">last survey</a> in <i>One</i> there was evidence of a variety of thoughts in this area already ongoing on campus. Collecting the current progress at RISD, and then prioritizing where we look to the future is a likely next step. </p>\n<p>The fact that many &#8220;green prizes&#8221; have been adopted and competitions like Solar Decath etc are continually on the rise means more institutions look to hang their banner and hopes on the all important resource of our planet earth. How to connect all the dots of RISD to align around a theme of &#8220;green&#8221; is one of the many institutional challenges that can indeed be achieved with more communication on campus as to where we are, a collective sense of where we want to go, and just going there.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your thoughtful question, John\n</p><p/></div>",

And of course, who would want to forbid people from bringing in their babies to introduce them around?</p>\n<p>But as a member of the staff here I know all too many people who get/got stuck babysitting regularly for their boss&#8217;s kids - sometimes in self defense because an unsupervised child was getting into everything, sometimes from an expectation by the supervisor that they would drop their work and take care of the kid.

Any meeting involving a significant number of faculty is almost impossible to schedule during the day, except possibly on Friday afternoons, and often people prefer not to come in on a Friday.  Instruction Committee, CFA, they are a scheduling nightmare.  We have the Wednesday 4:30 block, but that is booked for the year before school even starts.  Could we create another block on Friday afternoon, and try to keep most full time faculty from teaching then so we could have another period where meetings could be scheduled?  Anyone think that might help?  Would people be willing to come in on Fridays?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>After thinking about scheduling and committees some more, I am wondering if we really could assign some of the major committees which meet often and involve a lot of faculty to days of the week, and faculty who are participating in those committees agree to work out their teaching schedule to clear those days?  If we had, say, Admissions and the Department Heads meetings on Monday, so that department heads agree not to teach on Monday morning, and people on the Admissions Committee don&#8217;t teach on Mondays at all, could that clear enough time that those groups wouldn&#8217;t have to meet in the evenings?  How about Instruction Committee and CFA on Fridays?  Would people agree to commit to committee assignments earlier, say in March, so the course schedule could be reset in time for the spring registration?   </p>\n<p>A number of faculty and staff have worked on scheduling and I wonder if they might weigh in on this?  I&#8217;d love to find a solution, since Academic Affairs staffs a lot of these committees and our people are impacted by the drain of evening meetings as well.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I understand the problems with unsupervised children or bosses asking employees to watch children. I&#8217;m actually a bit flabbergasted, however, that such situations even exist. It still sounds to me like bad parenting and abusive management are the problems rather than children in the workplace. Perhaps what rubbed me the wrong way was the negative tone and assumptions of the statement&#8211;&#8221;children and minors are not permitted unless&#8230;&#8221; rather than &#8220;children may visit if&#8230;&#8221; </p>\n<p>This has opened up a useful discussion on scheduling, though. Sheila, thanks for your ideas. I would enthusiastically welcome a reduction in evening meetings. Fridays would work well, if people would agree to it. And scheduling of classes based on major committee membership is more complicated, but I think it&#8217;s definitely an idea worth exploring. My other solution (on a personal basis) has been breakfast meetings (7:30 - 9 or so), though, of course, I understand that that hour is as bad as the evening for many people!\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Thanks to all for this discussion.  I am a single mama and I have a special needs child who simply has to be with me at times, and like you Daniel I am between a rock and a hard place on the scheduling issues.  I too wish that the individual cases of poor choices could have been handled individually and not led to this policy - for children or for pets.  I also got quite startled to see the two on the same page as if they are the same policy.  The pets issue is equally important but in different ways and for different reasons.</p>\n<p>When I first came to RISD the most positive comments I got from people associated with us was from those who had been involved as children - whether attending classes or just feeling welcome on campus.  I would hate to think that this policy makes any of us or our children feel like we are looking over our shoulders when we are in the RISD community.  There are so many places in the US that are not child or family friendly.  I hate to think that RISD might become one of those.</p>\n<p>I see that one faculty member usually brings a child to faculty meetings.  This does not bother me and I hope it does not bother the rest of the group.  Probably I will need to do the same at some point.  If it is going to be difficult for us to be parents and professionals than maybe the RISD community should help us find solutions.  A RISD creche for RISD babies in the day time and for RISD children in the evenings?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I agree with Dan.  I have never asked anyone in the workplace to look after my children, nor would I.   If the purpose of the new policy is to address that issue, then why not address it specifically and thoroughly, as would might expect in good design?</p>\n<p>A child over the age of 11 can read unsupervised in the Athenaeum.  Why not at RISD?  Any Hope High school student has free admission to the RISD Museum, &amp; can visit.  Unless he or she is the child of a member of the RISD community.  Minors are entitled to use public libraries, but are not permitted to visit the RISD campus unless under the immediate supervision of a parent, etc.  </p>\n<p>Is the problem the HR policy is intended to address with young children?  If so, why does it specify minors, i.e., any child up to the age of eighteen?</p>\n<p>I welcome Sheila&#8217;s suggestions.  Scheduling committee meetings during the day would also make such work visible as a substantial part of the work week.</p>\n<p>Visibility is an issue which concerns me here.  I have always found the interface between parenting &amp; work difficult.  I &#8220;do both,&#8221; as John says.  However, there is no tradition, in the academy, of women doing both.   A female professor was, and still is, less likely than a male professor, to have children.  Professors who are single mothers are rare birds, though not of course a protected species.  I feel exposed when Clio reads outside the faculty meeting, or even when she is with me at non-compulsory events and meetings which are for my benefit &amp; information, not hers.  But, as things get a bit easier for me, due to advancing years(!), I find I am willing to make my identity as a professor and parent more visible.  Maybe I&#8217;m also suggesting: This is unconventional but it is a possible model too.   I understand very well that I am in a tiny minority.  However, in the interests of diversity, probably my primary value, I speak here.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect faculty and staff at RISD to share my concerns.  I am really disappointed to see HR placing an actual obstacle in my way.  I&#8217;d welcome a more constructive move, like &#8220;In order to more fully acknowledge the demands of the contemporary workplace &amp; RISD&#8217;s commitment to establishing leadership in all areas of innovation, childcare will now be provided under the following conditions .&#8230;&#8221;  Or &#8220;In acknowledgment of the complexity of the contemporary workplace, and the specific gifts and challenges of an artistic community, RISD announces a childcare unit which will function as a practical and research resource for all in our community&#8230;.&#8221;  Truly amazing.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect students to share my concerns either.  I do note, however, that our student population is 70% female and children in the workplace is undoubtedly an issue which affects our graduates, both male and female.  The curriculum could articulate and theorize contemporary challenges for artists and designers in respect to family.  I&#8217;d be interested in talking to teachers who are doing this.   </p>\n<p>The studio is a space where profession and family sometimes overlap.  Teaching is also, in some ways, a profession hospitable to such overlap.  But children, pregnancy, family, must be removed from the educational equation.  What happens if a student at RISD becomes pregnant?  How widespread is Emergency Contraception use?  What is the experience of the pregnant graduate student?  Even by raising these questions, I feel I&#8217;m breaking a taboo.</p>\n<p>Likewise I feel I am breaking a taboo if I say,  &#8220;An Admissions Committee meeting costs me $40-$50.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;I paid $750 to someone I trust to take care of Clio so I could work in the EHP Program for a week, for no extra money, at a time I would not otherwise have been teaching.&#8221;  Only once in my time at RISD has there been acknowledgement of childcare costs, in this case for extended weekend meetings.</p>\n<p>The invisibility of children in the workplace has many costs &#8211; I would say culturally, educationally, communally, emotionally, financially, and professionally, though I don&#8217;t expect anyone to agree.  </p>\n<p>I would also ask: For a faculty member, what is the workplace?  Is it a set of buildings?  A set of responsibilities?  A set of hours?  I do a lot of my work at home.  I work during the night &amp; at weekends.<br/>\nAs far as writing is concerned, it&#8217;s hard for me to say: &#8220;This is work.&#8221;  It is my life, almost as much as my family.  Am I working only when I&#8217;m teaching?  What about the many events I organize?  They&#8217;re a vital part of teaching &amp; professional life for me.  I had planned to host a small poetry festival, SoundEye Providence, here at RISD next spring, modeled on the annual <a href=\"http://www.soundeye.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundEye Festival of the Arts of the Word</a> in Cork and last October&#8217;s SoundEye West at the <a href=\"http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/francophone/events/past_events/2007/soundeye.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Southern California</a>. </p>\n<p>My plan was to invite an exciting and diverse group of poets, from Ireland, England, the United States, Canada, and maybe South Africa (all depending on whether they could cover their own travel expenses &amp; come for no fee; I&#8217;d feed &amp; accommodate them), and to include the incredibly diverse poetry community here in Rhode Island, for talks and readings for two days at RISD, culminating in a marathon reading at Tazza.  Some of the participants would stay with me, some with other poets in Providence, some in a B &amp; B.  (Where is the workplace?) It would be an intense 2-3 days, morning to night.  (What are work hours?)  I was still figuring out the logistics of attempting this on a $5,000 budget, with numerous constraints, when HR&#8217;s new policy arrived in my inbox.  Could I manage this without the freedom to include Clio if I needed to?  No I could not.   I don&#8217;t want to be tolerated, or disapproved of, in my endeavors for RISD.  I want to be supported.  So the $5,000, in this instance, is a resource I can&#8217;t afford.  </p>\n<p>RISD&#8217;s new policy on children in the workplace seems to avoid more issues than it addresses.  What is a child&#8217;s &#8220;legitimate business&#8221; on campus?  </p>\n<p>I realize this is a long post &amp; I will conclude.  My dissertation topic was metaphor and one of my arguments was that when a human experience/relationship structure/identity is borrowed to give shape to a concept, often that which is borrowed from is in a weak condition.  For example, when a nation is described as a Motherland, often mothers in that nation are in a particularly weak position.  Or if a work of art is a &#8220;baby,&#8221; perhaps the artist&#8217;s flesh-and-blood babies must become abstract.  I often think of this when I hear RISD being described as a &#8220;family.&#8221;  An institution which imagines itself as a family may not cope very well with the realities of family life.</p>\n<p>My final point goes back to children.  Why confine HR&#8217;s policy to children under the age of 18?  Why not all family members?  Or at least all dependent or partially dependent family members?</p>\n<p>RISD is wonderful to our children in many respects.  One of the greatest things is that our children can participate for free or reduced tuition in CE classes.  I appreciate everything that is done, &amp; everything everyone has generously said here.  I&#8217;m glad of the opportunity to, with some difficulty, say my piece.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Having lived through bad old times at RISD, I completely understand and sympathize with the challenges parents face with night meetings, etc.  Just to give you an idea that it was even worse, all the years when my children were in daycare, faculty meeting used to meet at 6 pm on Wed.  Since participation in faculty meetings is contractually stipulated for full-time faculty, I used to teach during the day, go home to Barrington to pick up my kids from the day care, cook dinner, get the babysitter and drive back to RISD at least a few times a month (faculty meeting plus other meetings).  My husband relieved me of this double trip whenever he could, but he had his own night commitment, so we took turns.  Finally a faculty member complained at a faculty meeting that her day care closes at 6 pm, making  attendance at faculty meetings a real hardship.  This initiated the project to revamp the school-wide class scheduling, thanks to the massive (and largely invisible and thankless) work done by my colleague, Don Keefer, which resulted in moving the faculty meeting time to 4:30 which also created the common meeting time for other committees every Wed..  In addition, the new schedule created the &#8220;passing time&#8221; between classes, which did not exist at all with the old schedule.  I know the work Don had to do was massive, because there were so many considerations to take into account, such as the different time demand by Liberal Arts, studio, and Foundation, as well as the space constraint that always has plagued RISD.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember when the new schedule went into effect (10 years ago?) but things changed since then.  We probably have more space and some faculty have been experimenting with going off the prescribed class schedule grid, etc.  With more junior faculty members with children coming in, it may be time again to scrutinize our schedule, perhaps by creating a common meeting time in the middle of the day instead of later in the day.  This needs somebody who takes initiative to launch this massive effort, first researching the current schedule and how it is/is not working, space issues, etc.  Don has done it once and I am certain he does not have the stomach for anohter round; plus, he is on sabbatical.  Anybody willing to take it on?  </p>\n<p>When my children were younger, there was some talk about daycare at RISD or in conjunction with Brown, but apparently there was not enough interest or need at that time (I certainly could have used one).  Again, this may be a time for another look, as the situation has changed since then.  </p>\n<p>There is a lot of room for improvement for making RISD more family-friendly work place.  I do want to remind everyone, however, that insofar as the full-time faculty contract goes, it guaranteed up to a year of parental leave when my kids were born (20 and 24 now), way before the federal family leave act took effect and when other area colleges and universities (including Brown) did not have any provision.  Boy, was I grateful to the guarantee that I will not lose my job after taking a semester off!!  This was all thanks to the union contract.  There are many other benefits in the current contract that I hope will not be compromised in any way in the next round of contract negotiations.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi all. I just read the Bernie-the-dog thread. And the Mairead children in the workplace thread. </p>\n<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>\n<p>First of all&#8230; The old children and animals issue. Children vs animals. Children as animals. Children or animals. Children are animals!? </p>\n<p>Why does it always seem to come to this. </p>\n<p>Here is a big difference: Children cannot be left alone at home or they will burn the house down, fall into a well, drink the draino, open the door to strangers, feed draino to the animals, etc etc. </p>\n<p>Animals left at home will pee on the wall. Bark. or Meow. (pick your sound)</p>\n<p>At the end of the semester we had a student arrive for her final crit with her little purse-sized doggie in her arms. For the first time I actually felt that this animal was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Normally I am in favor of a relaxed attitude in all things animal and child related&#8230; but this little pooch-accessory was over the top and inappropriate.</p>\n<p>But hello, the bigger question: why in 2008 are we still having this discussion about children and childcare? Why can&#8217;t RISD get ahead of the game on innovative approaches to supporting faculty and staff *with* families? Lets be thinkers about this! Lets be designers. And lets solve this.</p>\n<p>Could we begin with a few basic questions? how many kids are we talking about in this community? How many faculty/staff are both primary bread winners and primary caregivers? How hard would it be to solve this problem? Geez: even Golds Gym now has daycare! Maybe we could begin with a once a month day care set-up. Say, first Wednesdays of the month, around 4:30 in or near the BEB?</p>\n<p>But seriously, I am afraid that until this issue is resolved there are days when my children will be on campus (supervised), or I can&#8217;t be. One of the best things about this community is the feeling that, within reason, people are incredibly flexible, understanding, open and imaginative about making life work. Every life is difficult in some way. Many of us deal with children, pets, health issues, parking issues, commuting. From the serious to the mundane, there is an awful lot to juggle and RISD has always been a great place to work while managing life. But in a culture of art/design/humanities, where we talk so much about ways in which our community of thinking artists and designers can benefit society at large, it does seem remarkable that RISD does not overtly address issues of family and childcare as a clear priority in our community.</p>\n<p>Again, my students and colleagues are always very understanding ( I have 2 kids: a 1 year-old and a 4 year-old), but as a whole the strucure of the school, the schedules, and the lack of childcare or childcare-friendly hours, is awkward to say the least. I was very lucky to receive six weeks of paid leave upon the birth of my second child. And a semester unpaid so I could be at home and not lose my job. And HR was very helpful, very sympathetic. Now that I am back at work full time, running my practice and doing research, attending meetings and constantly working toward studio preparation and course improvement, the issue of juggling family life is terribly real. I have brought my feisty four year old to faculty meetings once or twice with mixed results. But babysitters quit, life-partners arent always around, and you just can&#8217;t leave kids alone at home. </p>\n<p>I think this whole discussion belies a deeper problem in our country. Swedes have a different approach: a basic fundamental belief that improving the lot for families improves life for everyone. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3770605.stm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3770605.stm</a><br/>\nBut here I believe we have actually developed an insidious and unspoken prejudice against children. Does that sound radical? Look at Mairead&#8217;s comments. More than once she suggests that she &#8220;feels exposed&#8221; when bringing her child onto campus. That this culture suggests that our children are to be kept invisible, that we shouldnt trouble our colleagues with family issues! Friends, this is just plain wrong. The mission of this institution is to educate. Families with children are our clients. Our bread and butter. Our own museum is charged with developing family and childrens programming, while our faculty and staff with children are left to sort out their kid issues with no institutional support. It is as if we should simply have made the choice not to have children. Is it still true today that at RISD most of the faculty with children are male professors whose wives are able to be home with the kids? I don&#8217;t know though it is the conventional wisdom. In my household I am both the primary caregiver and the primary wage earner. While this may not be the norm, it grows increasingly more common. Lets please not let this subject drop! What next? I am eager to try and help solve this dilemma. Parents? Should we call a meeting to discuss this further?</p>\n<p>A young female student came to me in tears once a few years ago because it had dawned on her that she had no examples in her life of professional women who also had children. None of her female instructors had kids and she thought (erroneously I told her) that she would have to choose between work and children. If 70 percent of our students are women, lets consider the example we are setting. Lets make RISD a truly revolutionary institution and prove that women really can do both. And show that our college embraces this approach to living and working and child rearing simultaneously. Here&#8217;s to the Swedes!\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of &#8220;parents&#8221; at the tail end of Prof Hitchcock&#8217;s piece above, I should point out an area that is also becoming a major concern in the workplace &#8212; and that is of aging parents. I was the Co-Chair at MIT of a presidential council on &#8220;Work and Family&#8221; where we saw the increasing trend beyond the question of childcare to &#8220;eldercare&#8221; as becoming the number one growing concern in the workplace. </p>\n<p>And when I left MIT in June of this year, it was clear to me that MIT had not resolved the issue of how to address childcare or eldercare issues in the workplace. Thus I should note that the belief that &#8220;RISD does not overtly address issues of family and childcare&#8221; is not at all a view limited to RISD and encompasses most major universities and colleges out there including what I recently heard from a younger female professor at Stanford. </p>\n<p>Indeed the focus of RISD is <i>education</i> in all languages, definitions, and explanations of that important word. Everything springs forth from RISD&#8217;s <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/07/07/the-mission-possible/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission</a> that was put together two years ago (2006) as embodying RISD&#8217;s core priorities. In 2008 with a new president on board and with an ongoing attempt to increase the ability to share information amongst ourselves, how will we find ways together to align with, or diverge from, the stated 2006 mission &#8230; is an <i>open</i> question.</p>\n<p>I believe that everything we do at RISD must tie towards core priorities &#8212; priorities meaning there is a limited set of major goals to go after, and all other goals must be de-prioritized in order to achieve focus. Education starts with students, that come to be educated by faculty, in excellent facilities with supportive staff, the local Providence cityscape serves a role, and the greater world serves yet another context for all of our existence, and, finally, together as a community we watch our students trek towards the path to becoming alumni and citizens of our world. And the cycle continues onward. Yes, education is our focus. And everything we do for everyone at RISD matters to make that educational experience even better. Together in this forum and near the water cooler and in random chats around RISD, we are all learning together how to ask the questions that can make RISD <i>better</i>. Keep the questions and critical thinking coming. We&#8217;ll transition to the critical doing in the process of our communications.</p>\n<p>On a toast to the Swedes, we shouldn&#8217;t forget that Sweden manages to have incredible social policies for their citizens because of their massive income tax. In spite of their taxation, I&#8217;m happy to toast the Swedes as an Abba fan.</p>\n<p>I continue to listen and learn. Thanks to all for coming to Two and teaching not only me, but all of us, about what matters to RISD in all dimensions. </p>\n<p>-John</p>\n<p><b>PS For students that may be peeking into this strand, I raised the eldercare issue mentioned above in passing conversation with an MIT undergrad once saying something to the effect &#8220;&#8230; but you&#8217;re a student and wouldn&#8217;t understand what eldercare means&#8221; and her quick response was, &#8220;No, I see my parents all the time trying to figure out how to take care of my grandparents.&#8221; It&#8217;s important to see what&#8217;s coming for in your own future, students.

        "content": "<div><p>I imagine the impetus for the new HR policy was to create a more efficient and harmonious workplace, as perhaps there were a few individual incidences where people imposed on their colleagues or stifled productivity.  However, my concerns about the new policy are twofold.  First, the wording of the actual policy insinuates that children are an institutional burden&#8211;i.e., a problem to be dealt with.  In this sense, parenthood becomes a socially stigmatized identity&#8211;something to be kept hidden and separate from the RISD community.  I think that, as an institution, we grow stronger by embracing the diverse aspects of community members&#8217; lives, including our family life.  Just as we are a RISD family, our spouses/partners, children, and parents are also a part of that community.  Although I recognize the need to create policies that make our work life more orderly and organized, we should also be concerned about the implied meaning behind such policies.  My second concern about the policy is less about what is written in the policy, but rather what is missing.  The policy highlights an issue of growing concern, but does not offer a solution to address the needs of community members.   If parents have started to bring their children to work, it likely signals a problem in being able to find adequate childcare.  Rather than dealing with the source of the problem by helping members of the RISD community find reliable, affordable childcare, the new policy has merely made it difficult for parents in tight situations to fulfill both their parental and work obligations.   It is unlikely productivity is increased when a parent is worried about the reliability of their childcare or missing work obligations to handle childcare issues.</p>\n<p>Aside from being a burden to parents in general, policies that make the coordination of work and family more difficult disproportionately affect women.  Last semester, I taught the Psychology of Gender.  Of all the gender issues in society we discussed, my students seemed most interested in the problem of gender and family&#8217;s relation to the work force.  The women of my class shared their concern about how they would negotiate the demands of work and family, given that they all aspired to having successful careers.  Many wondered whether they would be able to have both, and felt that women were often forced to choose between one or the other.  One senior student in the class told us about a job interview she went on where the potential employer asked her if she was planning to marry soon or have children.  Despite the illegality of the question, the company clearly viewed female applicants with suspicion (as it is unlikely that male applicants were asked this same question).  Research shows that the wage gap between men and women is relatively small when entering the workforce and changes dramatically when women have children (even accounting for time out of the workforce due to pregnancy, sick children, etc.).  We live in a country that does not support duel career or single parent households.  Although the traditional model of having a male &#8220;breadwinner&#8221; and a stay at home mom is increasingly rare, the policies that govern American work life still support such a model.  In rankings of parental leave policies around the world, the United States ranks with Swaziland and Lesotho as having the worst <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/travaildatabase/servlet/maternityprotection\" rel=\"nofollow\">provisions for parental leave</a>.  Just because we live in a society that has not fully addressed the need to help families balance the demands of work and family obligations does not mean we at RISD cannot strive to be better.  In the same class discussions about family and work, my students candidly asked me if I would even be able to have children given the demands of being a full-time faculty.  It reminded me of a conversation I had had with a part-time faculty about her career.  She confided that after she had her first child, she realized she could never attempt a full-time, tenure-track faculty position.  In an ideal work environment, people would not have to stifle their career goals to have a healthy and enriching home life (whether that be with or without children).  I offer these examples because I think they demonstrate how an organization&#8217;s stance on the role of family in the workplace not only affects current faculty and staff, but also has larger societal implications and impacts the decisions of talented individuals who may decide not to apply or accept employment at an institution if they believe the institution doesn&#8217;t support their needs.  </p>\n<p>As Yuriko pointed out, RISD has already done many things to address the needs of parents (e.g., offering family leave, shifting the timing of meetings), but I believe improvement in this area should be an ongoing process, otherwise we risk falling behind other institutions.  Many companies and academic institutions have enacted formal policies or de facto practices that make the balance between work and home life easier on their employees (e.g., flexible work schedules, on-site daycare).   Research by psychologists suggests that organizations that adopt family friendly policies benefit from increased employee productivity and commitment, as well as decreased turnover, absenteeism, and work-related strain (see Diane Halpern&#8217;s 2005 American Psychologist article for an elaboration on this).   Thus, in an effort to make positive changes that could benefit RISD employees and the institution as a whole, I think we need to form a committee or taskforce to investigate ways to make RISD a more family friendly work environment.  I hope that others support such an initiative and that some good can come out of this new policy, in that it starts a dialog on how we can better fulfill the needs (both personal and professional) of our community.\n</p><p/></div>",

By having an open forum like this, we can share information across all constituents and talk about issues and figure out ways forward for the entire community. The issues described above face both faculty and staff, and perhaps to some students as well. And as I&#8217;m constantly reminded by the good Candace Baer, it also is not limited solely to women as we live in a society where men count in the equation of childcare and eldercare as well. </p>\n<p>It is my understanding that RISD has a a wide range of standing and ad hoc committees that cover a great deal of topic areas. If there&#8217;s one thing I learned at MIT, it is that ironically the formation of committees that effectively creates more work for faculty and staff. What is generally required is an overall sense of institutional priorities that can help guide how RISD and all of its parts and constituents can understand all the major issues at hand that we face together. They are numerous and all equally important for our collective sanity and the common pursuit of sustaining academic passion. </p>\n<p>Process-wise looking ahead, it would be useful for the existing committee structures at RISD to cooperate and get a sense of the landscape of issues we all face. I know that the Faculty Steering Committee and Staff Council are key venues, as well as for students the respective Student Alliances for undergrad and grad exist. Is there a way to get this topic on the agenda of these groups? </p>\n<p>So, an interesting twist in how we are activating RISD&#8217;s community with something like this online forum, is that normally issues surface in a variety of ways and get to the president. I believe that we are the first academic community around where the president retains the equivalent of &#8220;office hours&#8221; here on <i>Two.</i> I continue to learn and look forward to learning more. </p>\n<p>Thank you, -John\n</p><p/></div>",

Aside from managing Human Resources area I am, like many of you and many in my department, a working parent of young children and a daughter to aging parents.  Well, after your feedback, I realized our intent was not communicated as well as it could have been.  First, in the words we chose and second, policies around pets on campus are very different and need to be handled differently from policies around visiting children and/or other relatives on campus.   Thanks Mairead and others for your feedback.  </p>\n<p>Context<br/>\nSo why did we create such a policy?</p>\n<p>I joined RISD in 2006.  Since that time there has been a growing number of concerns from employees about the lack of supervision of children on our campus.  This past year we learned of children left alone, unsupervised, in classrooms in the evening, others dropped of to be cared for by department assistants and still others found wandering our corridors.  These issues and the concern they raised led to this action.</p>\n<p>The Policy</p>\n<p>As for this policy, we missed the boat&#8230;and did not intend to create a policy that makes it more difficult to navigate work/life balance.  What we did intend, and I echo Ginny here, is to help create a more safe and respectful environment.  We appreciate your respectful thoughts and feedback on the blog, and encourage this continued dialogue not only on the blog, but also via face-to-face communication&#8211;</p>\n<p>So, where do we go from here?</p>\n<p>We all want a respectful community that  supports work/life balance.  But what about the greater issue as Jennifer says of &#8220;embracing the diverse aspects of community members lives including our family life&#8221;  One thing about working for a President who has five children&#8211;he gets it!  And so, we have the opportunity to truly examine and create a new RISD reality for working parents and people without children, around issues of eldercare, life balance, you name it&#8211;And it seems that Sheila&#8217;s suggestions around new ways to look at scheduling meetings definitely needs further exploration.</p>\n<p>Next Steps</p>\n<p>With John&#8217;s support, I will be reaching out to Nicole Merola-Faculty Committee, Candy Seel-Staff Council and others to create a forum for discussion &#8211;involving all constituencies&#8211;yes, students too&#8211;from daycare to eldercare to retirement funding there is much to discuss.  I hope that y&#8217;all will be open to placing your passion and your support towards forward movement on these issues.  </p>\n<p>Thanks-<br/>\nCandace\n</p><p/></div>",

We talked about the possibility of scheduling classes and meetings with greater family considerations (families being defined as those with kids AND without), we talked about child care (on campus? cooperative? off campus?), we talked about language, about the spirit of RISD as an inclusive and welcoming place (and how to improve that quality) and so forth. Nice. HR is going to move ahead to create a task force to look into some of these issues further and to determine next steps. This is not to be a permanent committee by any means but rather a group committed to a limited time frame doing a specific task.

Children in the workplace is an issue very personal to me &amp; as a result I&#8217;m not very good talking about it.  It&#8217;s a difficult issue too, as work &amp; children are quite bound up for me.  I was running a theatre/art gallery/coffee-shop  in Ireland until I became a single parent &amp; deduced that 7-day/night weeks, 52 weeks a year would by no means work for me.  So I went back to school &amp; qualified as a teacher.  One thing led to another &amp; here I am at RISD.</p>\n<p>The range of perspectives at the meeting was very striking.  I wish I had taken notes throughout.  As Ginnie and others said, many on campus are very relieved to have a HR policy to invoke.  It is very certain that it is not part of any RISD employee&#8217;s job description to look after anyone&#8217;s children.  Maybe some day it will be, when RISD offers childcare to employees as some other institutions do.</p>\n<p>Yuriko&#8217;s contribution was a strong reminder of how difficult, and isolating it is,  for full-time female faculty to have children.  But, as Lucy said, female students are thirsty for models of how to have both a career and a family.  My own older daughter, who is a Senior at Brown, says that this is a burning question among her peers.</p>\n<p>In what sense is RISD a family?  This is part of the bolder question Claudia asked, about community.  What will the workplace of the future look like, in relation to the 8-hour day, strict divisions between work &amp; home, &amp; staff, faculty &amp; student diversity?  Does an institute of education have a leadership brief in this area, which some see as crucial?</p>\n<p>There seemed to be a stunning array of questions &amp; comments at the meeting.  Candy Seel pointed out that this is an issue where staff, faculty, &amp; students can all come together.  It&#8217;s certainly one of the most sobering, &amp; simultaneously joyous conversations we could have.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Hardu Keck&#8217;s convocation addresses recently.  I knew him only briefly when I came to RISD first but I know him much, much better through these addresses, which deserve a post of their own.  I&#8217;m just referring to them to make a minor observation about how conventional &amp; acceptable it is to include Presidents&#8217; wives in institutional occasions: Hardu made a point of particularly welcoming Roger and Gayle Mandle.  You see the same thing with the Obamas &amp; Bidens.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to observe the Palins (I wish she was married to Michael!) in this respect.  I&#8217;d welcome insight from RISD scholars about what type of family presence institutions welcome, &amp; what type they reject, &amp; possible reasons why. </p>\n<p>I wonder also if the traditional institution of marriage and the workplace have defined each other, especially in areas of work above the minimum wage.  Sometimes it seems that a woman can have rights in the work place, but only if she makes family invisible; and vice versa.  You can do both but we haven&#8217;t developed policy &amp; structures for doing so.\n</p><p/></div>",

Well if it wasn&#8217;t clear before, <i>it will be now.</i> </p>\n<p>Education has always been there in RISD&#8217;s blood <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design\">since 1877</a>, and even <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/07/07/the-mission-possible/\">as recently as 2006</a> as stated in its mission. Art and education are inseparable as developed so eloquently in <a href=\"http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/eandc/vol22/iss1/art4/\">the work of John Dewey.</a> </p>\n<p>Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Prof <b>Gareth Jones</b> about the nature of education as practiced at RISD from the foundational studies perspective. His concept of the need for &#8220;pure discourse&#8221; as opposed to purely serving the needs of the market is something that I strongly resonate with, and recognize as the fundamental goal in life &#8212; which is to achieve <i>balance.</i> </p>\n<p>Is education a mirror (to self-reflect what is within a student) or a lamp (for a student to sit within the glow of an educational experience)? Prof Jones concludes that<br/></p><blockquote>The responsibility of education, primarily, is to illuminate, not reflect. These conditions are not mutually exclusive, but the current between them is one-way. A mirror can enhance the light of a lamp. But a lamp cannot increase the reflectiveness of a mirror.</blockquote>\n<p>My comment to Prof Jones was, &#8220;But what about a mirrored lamp?&#8221; To which he raised an eyebrow way high. Yes. I do care about these questions about education today. RISD is now a two-way space of discourse on the important question of education in the 21st century. I am proud to be here and to learn together with all of you. Let us all walk into the light from the lamp, from the mirror, and from the sun up high and the brilliant minds that surround us all. And let us radiate the light of RISD outwards with our signature passion. </p>\n<p>Have a great week! -John</p></div>",

Allowing the entire community access to these thought processses and conversations gives the students the chance to do more than absorb light.  They can make some of their own.</p>\n<p> My RISD experience included several instances of two-way learning, that is, information disseminated to students from faculty, chewed on, reorganised, and given back so that it could be further explored and returned again.</p>\n<p>At first, as a student, this educational model was off-putting.  I expected to have the lamp turned on at a certain time every week, to absorb its glow for a specific period of time, and then to shut it off and go about my day.  When this failed to happen, I was initially frustrated, but as I got used to the idea that learning was active, that this was more pas-de-deux than solo, I was able to start to learn in a new way, and to be open to finding even more outlandish methods of knowledge assimilation and application.</p>\n<p>This model may not work in every instance, but it was exciting to be a part of it, and it was really in keeping with where it seems that RISD wants to go.</p>\n<p>Rosemary:  The thing about the blind is that, often, their other senses are heightened.  I am glad that you asked that question.  Sometimes touch is the best way to learn, sometimes hearing.  Sometimes smell.  I forget how quickly I fall back into standard assumptions, and your question reminded me of that.  I closed my eyes just now, and the landscape around me changed radically.

A few consistent traits I have seen in people who &#8220;get it&#8221; are:<br/>\n&#8226;\tListen and are able to be influenced by what they hear.<br/>\n&#8226;\tBuild trust by their actions.<br/>\n&#8226;\tFocus on the strengths of people who make up the team.<br/>\n&#8226;\tDo not treat everyone the same but do treat people equally.<br/>\n&#8226;\tUse defining moments to make them wiser and their area stronger.<br/>\n&#8226;\tResults are organic not orchestrated.<br/>\n&#8226;\tHas an appreciation for rules and guiding principles but is governed by common sense.<br/>\n&#8226;\tUnderstands that work is hard and stuff happens.<br/>\n&#8226;\tCan bridge the gap between visionary and getting the day to day work done effectively.<br/>\nI have never been blessed with an exceptional teacher or professor in my life. When I entered the hospitality industry I did had the privilege to work for a man named Laurie Bongiorno. For me he defined excellence in everything he touched and luckily he touched me. It has been twenty years since I worked for him and I knew he left Hyatt to open The White Barn Inn so I googled him to catch up. I found out that he has passed away. He was fifty-three.  I sat in my office devastated. I guess a really extraordinary boss or leader leaves a legacy behind.\n</p><p/></div>",

I think this was my first formal introduction to the word &#8220;leader&#8221; &#8212; like most of us here perhaps. Although I think that a more apt name for that game some of us played as children would be, &#8220;Follow the dictator.&#8221; Because everyone in line really didn&#8217;t have a choice. </p>\n<p>We live in a world of choices. Some better than others. Some that may be better now, and worse later. At RISD we live in a culture of artists and designers &#8212; free thinkers. Academia is inherently about free-thinking &#8230; so adding the art and design dimension on top of it all makes us like a super-free-thinking system that is probably in the 0.1% percentile of how we embrace free-thinking.</p>\n<p>At RISD we also live in a world of critique. I have seen and heard the majority of <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/06/27/the-value-of-crits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">style of critique at RISD</a> to be wholly constructive as opposed to simply destructive. There is a fine line that separates &#8220;being honest&#8221; and &#8220;being mean.&#8221; Having been on the receiving end in my life of a great deal of destructive critique as a designer, artist, and technologist &#8230; I can say that to be &#8220;destroyed&#8221; by another over and over again pays its emotional and physical toll. In my case, it has forced me to believe in the power of positivity through the uplifting people and experiences that one encounters in life in all forms &#8212; jovial bus driver, brilliant painter, fixated gardener, fastidious Home Depot clerk, yellow flower, buzzing insect, cold wind, the drizzling rain, and I listen constantly to the power of our environment. I continue to listen and learn. We all continue to listen and learn together.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all for your ideas on leadership &#8212; and please ask your colleagues to provide their views as well. We all do not have one single definition of leadership as our contexts are exquisitely unique. Free will governs that we are led by our hearts &#8212; to understand each others hearts, and to organically change/bend/adapt/deny each others&#8217; will &#8230; lies at the basis of our common sense of humanity. Life, leads us forward.\n</p><p/></div>",

Indeed as thoughtfully pointed out to me by the Faculty member, <i>&#8220;The belief in ever-increasing growth, the linking of the health of our economy to a military industrial complex, even the outrageous salaries for entertainment figures, all have contributed to the decline of the US economy and the stagnation of developing economies in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, Europe, and the Pacific.

This simple idea of &#8220;positive and proactive&#8221; that began this post &#8212; it embodies what I believe is core and important.

If you want to post information about other people, there may be libel or privacy implications to consider.  And so on.

As you can see, just getting them running at first will take a while as the system is so experimental. We didn&#8217;t want it to be a boring Airport Public Messaging System or some rolling PowerPoint deck. So it is the elegant (and initially unstable) system that you see there. Static images and texts are the first step. As for integrating video and other dynamic things like that, it will lend to more instabilities, so first things first. And as someone known for a little more than dabbling in dynamic media, I found <a href=\"http://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com/2008/09/05/top-15-criteria-define-interactive-or-new-media-art/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this posting</a> quite funny and disturbingly accurate. A conservative estimated date to integrate video into the messaging system is probably never. That said, running a Quicktime streaming video client on the screens would be an alternative mode that could be imagined for the future like with on-campus key events like the Convocation.</p>\n<p>And on the general video front, we have the initial groundwork underway to enable RISD&#8217;s ability to broadcast video and audio content at state-of-the-art levels over the Web using the Brightcove client. But there&#8217;s still a lot of groundwork to be laid there. I&#8217;d like to imagine RISD TV shows produced by students to be broadcast eventually through that network. I have a fetish for cooking shows so if you know of any good RISD &#8220;how to cook&#8221; videos let me know. -John\n</p><p/></div>",

Criminals target the quad area especially hard for the first few weeks of the school year while the new members of the community are still somewhat naive to their scams.

Crime in general ebbs and flows with the economic times. Right now we see a general increase in property crime here in Providence. For instance a big ticket item is the &#8220;Side Kick&#8221; cell phone. If you have it out there is a good chance you could be robbed. So here a property crime for quick cash becomes a crime against a person. Another big item? Copper! Put your house up for sale and move before it is sold? Real good chance every piece of copper in the house will be gone before the &#8220;Sold&#8221; sign is posted.  Crime Prevention is a big thing for us in Public Safety so we will continue to work on those alerts.  Along with Adam I want to know how you feel about the local crime, Public Safety, Providence Police and Fire Department, RI Courts and the Law if need be.

There&#8217;s an extremely high level of dedication to keep our students, faculty, and staff safe on campus by the PS officers. The midnight special service offered by PS is above and beyond the call of duty and is done for the love of our RISD students. And yes I have to agree with Chief Bilodeau that staying way late into the wee hours of the morning that &#8220;living in studio at RISD&#8221; isn&#8217;t a great idea in general to live one&#8217;s life &#8230; but as an overly-impassioned artist and designer myself, I do know the drill.</p>\n<p>In all cases, if you don&#8217;t feel safe late at night, do call PS as they can advise you best to your safest options.

        "content": "<div><p>Getting mugged/attacked on campus has been a concern of mine since I transferred in as a sophomore two years ago.  I lived straight down Prospect Street, almost to Olney -  It was kinda the &#8220;beeline to the Hill Ghetto&#8221;, as I was warned upon visiting the Res Life office when I was still just an accepted transfer concerned about housing.  During the summer session &#8216;06, there were reports constantly about kids getting their ipods and cell phones stolen, and my possible routes home were hotbeds of activity.<br/>\nEven with the warnings, I don&#8217;t think some students realize how big of a target they make themselves sometimes.  Girls in short skirts with no pockets walk around in floppy shoes holding their ipod/cell phone in one hand and/or carrying bulky art supplies in the other.  Criminals can see those bright white ipod earbuds from a block away, and have plenty of time to decide whether or not they can get away with grabbing your stuff.  Walking around talking on cell phones or text messaging people in public isn&#8217;t just multi-tasking - it makes you an easy target because it shows off how cool you are for having the latest stuff.<br/>\nI refused to stay at school past 10pm because I was scared of being out late by myself.  I went to school earlier in the mornings so I wouldn&#8217;t have to stay late, and took the SafeRide home almost every night.  Twice I stayed past regular route times and had the horror of dealing with Saferide afterhours at 1:30 in the morning.  One time I was standing alone on the corner of College and Main for over 45 minutes in the freezing cold.<br/>\nI&#8217;ve moved further away now anyway, so I take a regular RIPTA bus home.  Saferide is no longer an option and the quality of it&#8217;s service is technically no longer a major concern.  But common sense, awareness of my surroundings and getting home safely still are.  I have to follow RIPTA&#8217;s schedule and they won&#8217;t be available to take me home at 3am if I stayed that late, and they certainly aren&#8217;t going to change that just because I go to RISD.<br/>\nHere&#8217;s some tips:  If you&#8217;re going to wear earbuds, run the wire down the back of your shirt and keep the ipod in your pocket.  Girls, GET POCKETS! Wear comfortable shoes and walk like you have purpose.  Go home earlier!  It&#8217;s so hardcore to stay all night at the studio strung out on energy drinks busting ass on an awesome project - but it&#8217;s not healthy or safe.   It&#8217;s irresponsible and RISD shouldn&#8217;t waste a ton of money trying to provide 24 hour a day protection.  Besides, that project might not really be that awesome in the light of day after working on it all night in a sleep deprived haze.<br/>\nAnyway, I&#8217;ve written enough for this session.  Students need to be more proactive about their own safety.  Public transportation doesn&#8217;t run 24 hours a day.  It runs on a schedule and getting home safe is a citizen&#8217;s responsibility - and it sure isn&#8217;t usually FREE.\n</p><p/></div>",

At the final buzzer the Balls lost by around 7 points.</i></p>\n<p>The good news&#8230;. Over 400 students, along with a few faculty and staff showed up for the game, a raucous wonderfully RISD crowd. We had to bring in extra chairs and students sat on the floor ringing the playing area. At around 7:50 when we determined that Pratt was only at the RI border over a half hour away, I announced this to the crowd to groans of disappointment and only a very few fans got up and left. (I believe that most came back because we seemed to have even more people at game time) So everyone sat there determined to wait, so we decided to have a half court shooting contest for a gift certificate to RISD store. We varied the distances until we got a winner&#8230; I then got the players to run a game of shootout with some fans including Painting dept head Dennis Congdon and that was pretty funny and killed another 15 minutes or so. Then in truly RISD fashion a variety of artsy folk started lining up to shoot the ball in ways that only they could express. We had music and it was a nice festive atmosphere with people watching, talking and just hanging out.</p>\n<p>We started the game close to 9pm and the officials decided to play each half 5 game minutes shorter. This worked to the benefit of Pratt &#8230;they would have had a harder time keeping up as the game wore on since we had a much deeper team.</p>\n<p>Pratt jumped out to an early 10 point lead. Our team was flat from all the hanging around, but the balls came back and at one point were 5 points ahead in the second half. Pratt had one very good player that hit 2 three point shots with 2 minutes left that just put the game out of reach.</p>\n<p>The team was disappointed of course, but the crowd gave them a big round of applause and the floor turned into a dance party for about 20 minutes after it was over.</p>\n<p>The roar of the crowd for every shot the Balls made, the spontaneous and improvisational heckling of Pratt players while taking foul shots, the art worthy and at times explicit signs that were displayed, were all very inclined to our culture. It was great fun and for the students particularly, a wonderful opportunity to get out and be together and do something &#8220;sort of like&#8221; other schools but in their own unique fashion.</p>\n<p>The representatives from Converse stayed to the end, offered encouraging comments like &#8220;the refs gave the game away&#8221; and vowed to come back for other games.</p>\n<p>Oh yes&#8230; coach Miller hit the only half court shot of the night and his victory lap was spectacular.\n</p><p/></div>",

(EHP I love you too!).  But the Many Eyes representations make me think of Liberal Arts in terms of hue and texture as much as structure, since the considerable structure isn&#8217;t represented.  In a way (&amp; this may be heresy) is Liberal Arts part of the curriculum of every undergraduate and graduate program?  Is there a way (here comes the heresy) for Liberal Arts &amp; the studio departments to move toward each other, integrate?  I&#8217;m not even sure how I feel about this myself, as I&#8217;m a great believer in structure &amp; know how hard won it is.  But there is a divisional stand-off between Liberal Arts &amp; at least some of the other divisions, which in any case announce themselves strongly as &#8220;departments,&#8221; not divisions.  Should Liberal Arts also announce itself in terms of departments, rather than a division?  Should those departments, as they are not degree-granting, relate much more closely to the studio departments?  How?  Or should the Liberal Arts departments also be degree- granting, with degrees very unique to RISD?  Foundation Studies seems close to Liberal Arts in some of these issues, although its student population is exclusively first year while Liberal Arts faculty can work recursively and progressively with students over 4-6 years.   Graduate Studies includes layers of Liberal Arts, including many courses actually offered by the Division of Liberal Arts.  What sort of visions do we have for Liberal Arts at RISD?<br/>\nIs the nomenclature/identity/structure dynamic or not at this point?\n</p><p/></div>",

I would encourage everything from club updates, weekly interviews with faculty and staff (maybe even president Maeda, I&#8217;ve heard he has a way with words) , live music sessions, to someone wanting to discuss their ideas about art/design and the future- TED-talks on a smaller scale.

However, while I certainly don&#8217;t want to further the impression that lawyers are just &#8220;wet blankets,&#8221; I do want to remind folks that what is technologically possible is not the same thing as what is legally permissible, let alone the same thing as what is ethically advisable.  Just as General Motors does not make cars that are incapable of speeding and Smith &amp; Wesson does not make guns that are incapable of murder, Al Gore did not build in all of the applicable legal restrictions when he invented the Internet.  In the end, the Internet is just a tool, and we bear the responsibility of using it legally and responsibly.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to post other people&#8217;s work, there will be copyright implications; consider whether there&#8217;s an applicable exception or whether you need a license or permission.  (As the RIAA is doing its best to make clear, the latter will almost always be the case with respect to the use of music.)  If you want to post information about other people, there may be libel or privacy implications to consider.  And so on.  Remember that, when you&#8217;re posting to the Internet, you&#8217;re essentially acting as an international publisher and broadcaster, which means that you&#8217;re subject to the same legal obligations &#8211; and liabilities &#8211; as any other international publisher and broadcaster.  That&#8217;s not a reason not to proceed, but it is a reason to do it the right way.</p>\n<p>Here are some good resources to help you think through these issues:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/pdfs/VirtualLegality2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virtual Legality: An Overview of Your Rights and Responsibilities in Cyberspace</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://w2.eff.org/bloggers/lg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legal Guide for Bloggers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_Legal_Guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">Podcasting Legal Guide</a></p>\n<p>I would also be happy to discuss these issues individually or in some kind of workshop or forum.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you&#8217;re posting your own materials to the Internet, remember that you have the power to make it easier for future users by granting permission prospectively on whatever terms you want.  <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons</a> offers one such model (though only one), and I strongly encourage you to consider it.</p>\n<p>Steve the Lawyer\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As tempting as the &#8220;ostrich&#8221; approach is when faced with something as complicated as copyright can be, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;d recommend it, for at least two reasons:</p>\n<p>First, anything that is posted to the public Internet is available for anyone to see, including the copyright owners, who are paying very close attention.  Moreover, the penalties for copyright infringement are quite high &#8211; as much as $150,000 in civil damages per infringement, as well as potential criminal sanctions &#8211; and ignorance is not a defense.  In one of its most recent cases (it&#8217;s filed more than 30,000 so far), the RIAA won <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/riaa-juror-we-w.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a judgment of $222,000</a> against a woman who had shared just 24 songs &#8211; and two of the jurors thought she should have to pay the statutory maximum of $3,600,000.  That&#8217;s as ridiculous and unfair to me as it probably is to you, but it is the law nonetheless, and we ignore it at our peril.</p>\n<p>Second, and even more important in my view, we should be especially mindful of these issues at an institution devoted to the creation of art and design.  Artists&#8217; and designers&#8217; livelihoods are dependent in large part on the creation of, and the respect of others for, intellectual property.  Just as you probably wish to protect the economic value of your own copyrights, so, too, do the musicians and other fellow artists whose work is being traded over the Internet without appropriate compensation.</p>\n<p>That said, there are a number of musicians (and others) who are happy to make their work available for others to use for free through <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons</a> or similar types of licenses.  You can find an extensive list of Creative Commons-licensed music <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/legalmusicforvideos\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n</p><p/></div>",

You&#8217;re also free to give prospective permission to others to use your work by including a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/license/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons-type license</a> when you post it, and I encourage you to consider doing so.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m certainly not saying that you can <i>never</i> use someone else&#8217;s work in your own.  Copyright is not absolute, and there are a number of exceptions that allow us to make such uses in certain circumstances and in certain ways.  One of the most important such exceptions for artists is &#8220;fair use,&#8221; which, in very general terms, allows the use of existing works in ways that yield broader social good without unduly impairing the ability of the copyright owners to exploit the value of their works.  (You can find a much lengthier, but still not terribly legalistic, explanation of the fair use doctrine in <a href=\"http://www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/so-what-about-copyright.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">So What . . . About Copyright?  What Artists Need to Know About Copyright and Trademarks</a>.)  That&#8217;s the basis, for example, of much of &#8220;appropriation art.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The problem is that just what constitutes fair use is rarely completely clear and almost always open to debate (and therefore lawsuits), which means that it&#8217;s a question of risk management as much as it is of pure law.  By way of illustration, Jeff Koons (an appropriation artist who can afford to take risks) has both <a href=\"http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/koons-wins.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">won</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_v._Koons\" rel=\"nofollow\">lost</a> cases that seemed to raise essentially identical fair use issues.</p>\n<p>Copyright is a particularly difficult problem for documentary filmmakers, who often unintentionally capture photographs, posters, ambient music, or other copyrighted works in the background and who, as a result, must consider whether they need to get permission or to reshoot.  The Center for Social Media at American University recently coordinated the development of <a href=\"http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/rock/backgrounddocs/bestpractices.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentary Filmmakers&#8217; Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use</a>, which offers another good discussion of how fair use works.\n</p><p/></div>",

I am a new staff member at RISD (Clinical Counselor in the Office of Student Development and Counseling), and I am VERY excited to be here! I moved to RI a year ago from IN, and I was unfamiliar with RISD until I came to RI. Now that I&#8217;m here and I have developed a knowledge and appreciation of RISD and its significance, I would like to hear from those who have been here longer than I have about what they feel makes RISD, RISD. Tell me about the RISD culture, what it means to you to be a part of RISD, what I should understand about this amazing place, well-kept secrets about RISD, and anything else you&#8217;d like to say about it. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading your responses, and I hope the information you provide will be helpful to all of us who are new to this fantastic institution. Thank you!</p></div>",

I&#8217;ve been part of the RISD community for 19 years both as a student and staff, and I sometimes tell people that I didn&#8217;t come to RISD to find simple happiness, but rather depth of experience.  The professors and students constantly challenged me to reevaluate my preconceptions, and hone my skills.  Sometimes that depth and challenge became overwhelming, but (with a little help from the kind folks in Student Development) I came out of the experience balanced, whole, and ready to face the world in any context.</p>\n<p>BTW, Met rice krispie treats are to die for!\n</p><p/></div>",

I graduated from Johnson &amp; Wales University in the late 90&#8217;s, and passed right by RISD multiple times on my way to a Brown event or party.  I must admit, I never really thought much about the place.  In fact it striked me as kind of &#8220;weird&#8221; if I can use the term loosely. Now that I have been a part of this community, going on 5 years now, I see why people are so fond of this school.  I suggest taking an Admissions tour one day so you can see the academic buildings.  That&#8217;s what really impressed me.  Use your lunch break to explore the community outside of your office.

It is also possible that some portion of hurricane Ike will follow Hanna next week. While at this time Hanna does not appear likely to cause a full blown emergency, we have an emergency management group planning for contingencies. Particular preparations are being made by people in Facilities, Dining, Student Affairs, Residence Life, Public Safety and Media + Partners. Academic Affairs is closely involved. And we are in touch with state and city emergency groups.</p>\n<p>Communications will come in several forms&#8211;there has already been one mass email. There will be email updates periodically. There will be web updates on both risd.edu and the Intranet. There will be paper postings around campus with phone numbers for help and information. It is possible that the RISD Alert system will be used&#8211;if members of the community have not yet entered their contact information in that system, they should do so.</p>\n<p>The worst effects of Hanna are likely to occur late Saturday and in the early morning hours of Sunday. We urge everyone to practice caution, to keep up with the communications, and to watch out for each other&#8217;s safety.</p>\n<p>I chair the core emergency management team which has members from many different parts of campus. While much good emergency planning has been done at RISD over the years, we will be using the coming year to expand and deepen our plans and to communicate them more broadly. We look forward to periodic communications about the planning and encourage questions and ideas from the community as we go. Meanwhile we ask that everyone become familiar with the emergency preparedness information posted on the Intranet and to be attentive to particular communications about emergency and safety issues this weekend and at all other times. Thank you! Arnie</p>\n<p>&#187; For issues and concerns regarding campus safety and security, contact <strong>Public Safety at 401 454-6376</strong>.

We are taught to realize time as the ultimate freedom, and not constraint, but at a very early age. In other words, the unavoidable cosmic mental burst-down that&#8217;s been known to ruin people (i.e that mid-life debacle) comes and goes around RISD at a time when we are most capable of learning from it. We are strong, and we don&#8217;t get scared easily, and we&#8217;ve got nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>My friend Adam Meyer observes that a Renaissance is brewing and i can feel it too&#8230;so I want to propose an outlet:</p>\n<p>A fair.

Limited objectives are defined by the people empowered to make those decisions as to choose say &#8220;a strawberry parfait&#8221; on Monday versus &#8220;a salty donut&#8221; on Tuesday on the community&#8217;s behalf. In this case, the area of RISD you want to speak to is clear. </p>\n<p>Since this is a student-led idea, the natural course is to go to the office of Student Life and follow the processes in place for realizing student-led initiatives. Ideas are vetted among existing alternatives based upon limited resources, and I know that there are students that are also naturally a part of that decision-making process. And then a decision is made. Yay or nay. I suggest you bring together a group of students and start that process. The folks in Student Life are here for that reason &#8212; to <i>enhance</i> students educational lives here at RISD.</p>\n<p>The Provost connects the Student Affairs component with the Academic Affairs component, and that is where other larger questions are constantly asked. So, if there is enough momentum and support that bubbles up all over the place, then the Provost is ultimately the one that can guide it into existence. But it all starts by leveraging the processes that enable the best ideas to bubble up, and for the ideas that may not just yet be ripe &#8230; remain on the tree of ideas for later consumption.</p>\n<p>In closing, I would add that the thing I love about the online space is that it transcends the exigencies of physical space and its implicit resource-based limitations. There is nothing to stop you from having a 3-hour session from 9PM to midnight to occur in Second Life (still a bit icky I know), in a building at Habbo Hotel (better), on an IRC channel (old school), or on a variety of new creative channels that I&#8217;m sure that RISD mind are yet to invent.</p>\n<p>Always think creatively about what can be done, and <i>how</i> it can be done with the same creative spirit and license.</p>\n<p>An artist is someone that will set out to paint a tree, and then mid-course, can choose to make the canvas she is painting on into a roof over her head. And it can return to its original purpose as a painting. An idea sends us somewhere. The artist inside ourselves can send it into a totally different somewhere to boot.  It is that <i>open-</i>ness that is the hallmark of the incredible creativity in our RISD DNA. It&#8217;s infective. I&#8217;m infected by it for sure. </p>\n<p>Have a nice day,<br/>\nJohn\n</p><p/></div>",

In the past, students have told me they are far from their home polling booths and/or forgot to arrange for their absentee ballots. Perhaps we could open up a temporary thread where people can share advice on voting, ballots, polling centers etc. Perhaps we could arrange some flexibility on election day, for studios *and* offices, so everyone can get a chance to vote! Its such a critical year&#8230;<br/>\nthanks. &#8211;Lucy</p></div>",

But in the event that it was not, I provide here a written synopsis. Although I&#8217;m a believer in moving images, I&#8217;m also a strong believer in the written word. And for those folks that couldn&#8217;t get in this year, we&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s enough capacity for you to come next year. And for those seniors who have never experienced a convocation for the three years you&#8217;ve been here, I promise we&#8217;ll do something interesting at a future alumni event for you.</i></p>\n<p>Since this was my first Convocation, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. You never know what is to happen in a darkened room. Provost Jessie Shefrin and her Operation-Convocation Team in Academic Affairs led by Peggy Lewis put a spectacular program together that started with live sitar music where the only production requirement was &#8220;a place to lay a mat on the floor to perform&#8221; and also included RISD&#8217;s newest &#8220;boy band&#8221; &#8212; the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/23/industrial-drummers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ID drummers</a>. Professor Mairead Byrne recited a poem commissioned by Provost Shefrin for Convocation entitled, &#8220;How to Write a Commissioned Poem&#8221; (What was the title again Prof Byrne? Please do post it here if you can.). It was a piece that showed how you can use language, abuse language, reconstitute language, and most importantly <i>make</i> language out of the English language.</p>\n<p>Museum Director Hope Alswang told us how there is nothing like seeing RISD students &#8220;hanging out&#8221; in the Museum &#8212; she noted the fact that the Museum has a digital-native-friendly cellphone-<i>okay</i> policy and noted how just sitting in the galleries gives students a &#8220;subliminal&#8221; experience by living in the middle of the Museum&#8217;s vast collection. I loved her story about how she had recently asked a RISD student who his favorite sculptor was out there in the art world right now &#8230; his answer, &#8220;Rodin.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Dean Joanne Stryker led the presentation of awards for Foundation Studies students from the previous year &#8212; and she did it in a way that honed in on three key themes: 1) rigor and discipline, 2) risk-taking, and 3) having a sense of humor. The three steps to success &#8212; it couldn&#8217;t be any more elegant and simple than that. This was followed by Professor Jonathan Highfield presenting the 1st year Writing Award. I love writing! Then, Provost Shefrin gave an inspiring talk about the nature of how we learn as artists, and how artists learn as people, too.</p>\n<p>A surprise guest appeared, RISD honorary degree awardee and artist <a href=\"http://www.annhamiltonstudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ann Hamilton</a>**, to talk about her chance encounter with Provost Shefrin due to the fact that Shefrin &#8220;needed to pay for a roof on her house so she taught a class&#8221; where Ann first met Shefrin as a student. Hamilton then led the entire audience in a large performance piece where we were taken through a variety of things said by Provost Shefrin in the past in the manner of an orchestrated reading. It was indeed surreal as pointed out by Professor Dematte and from what I heard it was literally painful for some (one professor remarked that his artificial hip couldn&#8217;t manage standing up for so long &#8212; yet it was more the physical pain of it all versus anything taste-wise <img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"/> ), and as with all art there were those who found great pleasure in the ritual. At first I didn&#8217;t quite get it &#8230; and began to reject it as I stood there reading. &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I thought to myself. And then, I let it come inside me. I stopped resisting it. And then I could truly feel what was happening to all of us in that room. We were becoming one. And it felt powerful. (** As I stood near Ann Hamilton in Market Square, I saw two students with tears welling up in their eyes to have the chance to meet one of their living artistic inspirations.)</p>\n<p>After Convocation a parent came up to me and expressed how impressed she was with Convocation and how disappointed she was that her child could not get into the auditorium. Our auditorium is not terribly large and not terribly small. Another parent suggested that the ceremony should be made only available to freshmen. And there were several people that came up to me and said that fire code restrictions should have not been obeyed and folks should have been let in &#8212; which of course legally would not be the right course of action. The law is an interesting constraint in our society &#8212; it keeps us safe, and yet sometimes it can make us insane.</p>\n<p>An entire group of 2012 freshmen came up to me and said how much they were energized by the ceremony, and another group of students came up to me psyched to start the year, and faculty came up to me in droves saying how, &#8220;It really felt like a new day.&#8221; Perhaps it is. It will be a new day if you let it in; it will be the same day if you keep it out. It&#8217;s America &#8212; and everyone at RISD has a choice to be who they want to be. It&#8217;s America &#8212; where you can say what you want to say based upon our strong belief that freedom of expression is an important value here. It&#8217;s RISD. Where our deft power of expression through words, marks, creases, bends, wind, spit, ink, paint, images, glances, performances, pots, cups, coffee makers, posters, gardens, buildings, living rooms, drawings, paintings, bits, bytes, wires, &#8230; is what makes us unique. Life is about choice. And RISD teaches us about the many choices we have with which <i>to say,</i> and to also how <i>to listen</i> to what is being said.</p>\n<p>To do something &#8230; anything &#8230; you are bound to make errors. There is no perfect action that can be taken in this world. It is the reason why making art is so difficult. It means you have to have the courage to make a mistake. And own up to its failures. And yet at the same time as an artist, to move forward you must believe that the action you have taken can/will/<u>might</u> make an impact &#8212; an impact that may be positive or negative or in the worst case, <i>just neutral</i>. And the true definition of whether you will <i>survive</i> as an artist (much less a question of whether you will succeed), is to keep on making things and moving forward. </p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m really excited about the idea of using the screens as a combo simulcast system &#8212; that never occurred to me at all. Thank you!</p>\n<p>(To attempt to complete this report, I also gave a short talk about how I feel about education, and art, and design. There&#8217;s so much to think about here at RISD. If there&#8217;s any major detail I&#8217;ve missed, please do holler!)\n</p><p/></div>",

I think it respected important precedents, like honoring last year&#8217;s freshman scholarship recipients and introducing new faculty members, dept. heads, etc. I also appreciated that it added new and unexpected elements, like the student percussion group and a commissioned poem written by a member of the faculty. I liked the easy camaraderie evident between the president and the provost, something that portends well for the future. I thought Hope Alswang gave a warm, spontaneous invitation to the RISD community to interact with the museum. And I liked that the occasion was used to welcome someone new to the position of provost, something that was not done for either of Jessie&#8217;s two predecessors in that office. Standing before a community of your peers to welcome them &#8216;to the conversation&#8217; is a nervy thing to do, but I&#8217;m grateful to Jessie for extending herself to us in this way.\n</p><p/></div>",

The magic of digital and other <i>live</i> media is that there&#8217;s always room to make things right. </p>\n<p>There was some research paper on the difference in accuracy between WIKIpedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica. The conclusion was that WIKIpedia had something like 5 errors per page, whereas the Encyclopedia Brittanica had only 3.

Civilized discourse is what we should promote in all our channels of communication. </p>\n<p>On the theme of risk taking, I applaud the courage of those who were willing to offer their less than enthusiastic assessments of the Convocation ceremony. I am not surprised that you heard so much positive feedback, because there was much about the ceremony that was positive, energizing and praiseworthy. However, I would be surprised if individuals came up to you and directly expressed their negative reactions, for in some cases it can be far riskier to one&#8217;s career advancement and livelihood to offer a contrary opinion instead of praise. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s America &#8212; where you can say what you want to say based upon our strong belief that freedom of expression is an important value here.&#8221; I would like to believe that the two.risd blog is a truly democratic forum for free expression, but in reading it most days I get the feeling that it is too much of a &#8220;me too,&#8221; get on the bandwagon, double ditto phenomena.

Yet indeed I recognize that my position/title will hold back a lot of information from me, so that&#8217;s why I come to this blog. To hear as wide a variety of opinions as possible is my intent and so I look forward to hearing more of what you and others you meet on the street have to say.

It&#8217;s the only way it will happen.</p>\n<p>Webster&#8217;s appropriately lists the first definition of <i>forum</i> as &#8220;a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged.&#8221; And indeed such an <i>exchange</i> is taking place if not only in this blog, but around campus as well. The fact that there are a different set of voices that are reflected in the different set of venues is easily remedied by a bridge like yourself. Or others. Or themselves. I for one certainly can&#8217;t go and find these candid people around campus unless I possibly walked around campus in disguise &#8230; but you certainly can do it faster than me so why not give the voices a voice?</p>\n<p>I have the volume of Hardu&#8217;s inspiring Convocation addresses that you point to. I think it would be great to make them into PDFs and be available online. Does anyone know where the source material is, or a URL where they might be stored? And maybe you and others can tell a few stories about Convocations of the past that were great, and teach us all about what made those Convocations great. Now is your chance. Anytime is your chance. I&#8217;m not going anywhere. I&#8217;m right here.</p>\n<p>One of the many inspiring things underlined by Dean Stryker at Convocation was the necessary regard for risk-taking in an artist and designer. Taking risks is about leaving your comfort zone. Often times your comfort zone is more than perfect &#8212; or as you point out, &#8220;the preceding day [wasn&#8217;t] all bad&#8221; &#8230; or even consider the definition of the word <i>comfort:</i> &#8220;a state of physical ease and freedom from pain.&#8221; </p>\n<p>For one who is completely comfortable, it makes absolutely no sense to leave that safety zone. But the nature of the creative mind is to always seek to do the non-obvious &#8212; to take a risk. As perhaps the only president that has a blog inside his campus with the added feature of anonymous-Tuesday, I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m responsibly being a risk-taker. The alternative would be to just sit in my office, never come to this blog, and not listen to anyone except the tens of people I might see or listen to in a single day in Provwash. And such a &#8220;normal&#8221; model of being a president is something I could adjust to &#8230;. but I personally could not do so with my responsibility and promise to RISD students to challenge the norm and be a creative leader whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Apollinaire once said, &#8220;New man must have the courage to be new.&#8221; I think he should have said instead, &#8220;Artists and designers must have the courage to be new.&#8221; This of course doesn&#8217;t mean that they can&#8217;t live based upon tried and true principles. To be new, you have to have a starting point &#8212; a basis that works. This is what you are saying effectively &#8212; &#8220;new days are good&#8221; and &#8220;preceding days are good&#8221; too. For the sake of debate I wish I could disagree with you, but we are in complete agreement on this point. </p>\n<p>RISD&#8217;s 130 years have a lot of great elements that we should never lose. And there are new ideas out there that we might want to explore. So, what are all of them in your mind, RISD? Speak up. You are heard here. All voices are welcome. Long ones. Fat ones. Spiky ones. Stinky ones. </p>\n<p>So, if you see a voice not represented here, go and get it and bring it here. The long arm of the blog is very short. See something missing? Tell me what *you* are going to do about it. Or at least talk candidly to a guy  on the street that looks sort of like me, but is wearing a plastic moustache and blue contact lenses.\n</p><p/></div>",

The purpose of this change is to add additional security and safety measures to our network to help ensure the protection of the network, all users, and all RISD systems and services.</p>\n<p>Effective August 18, 2008 &#8212; <strong>RISDWIFI</strong> is the official name for RISD&#8217;s new secure wireless network. The new wireless network requires a valid RISD network account (e-mail/network username &amp; password) for verification and will provide RISD users with more secure access to the Internet and all RISD network services.</p>\n<p>RISDWIFI replaces the older RISD-ROAMABOUT wireless network.</p>\n<p>RISD-ROAMABOUT will continue to operate in the following locations for a few more months: Museum, RISD Beach, Bank Building, some floors in Design Center, Auditorium, Waterman Basement, some floors in the ID Building, and Fletcher; until the new RISDWIFI can be installed into all existing wireless locations by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>OIT is also making available a GUEST Wireless Network: <strong>RISD-GUEST</strong>. This wireless network can be selected for those without RISD email accounts and for other guests who may need access to the RISD Wireless Network and the Internet. Guest users will have access to the Internet ONLY! RISD-GUEST is an open but unsecure wireless network.</p>\n<p>For more information about RISDWIFI and basic system configurations for both PC and MAC, please visit <a href=\"http://computing.risd.edu\">computing.risd.edu</a> and select RISDWIFI under &#8220;announcements&#8221;. If you have any questions, please contact the OIT Help Desk @ 6106 for additional information.</p>\n<p><em>*Currently, wireless access is not available in any of the RISD residential buildings.</em></p></div>",

He said to think of your cell phone. Is it reliable? Does it drop? You bet. Wi-fi is worse according to him. So he said to be sure to lower your expectations when it comes to a Wi-fi network. </p>\n<p>2/ Think of Wi-fi access like a public well. If one person is taking all the water (i.e. downloading a 7Gb data file) then the rest of the village won&#8217;t get any water. So the moral of the story is to sip Wi-fi instead of trying to drink too much.</p>\n<p>Thanks to OIT for advancing RISD Wi-fi to provide greater convenience for the growing population of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital natives</a> on campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

It was great to dish out food and dish out career advice as well. I discovered that the lion&#8217;s share of pasta-eaters living in the Met were Illustration and Graphic Design majors. What is it about pasta and 2-dimensional representation? Go figure.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I attended a dinner with the new RAs &#8212; the volunteer folks that are the backbone of the on-campus living groups. They are a great group of younger leaders that help to situate and connect new freshmen on campus. At the table I sat at, there was a student, Miguel, who was presenting some opinions about life at RISD as an international student. It was my first exposure to that perspective. I invite international students to post any particular things I should know about RISD. RAs and RA-knowers too. Thanks, John</p></div>",

The languages we discussed were Korean and Spanish, although we would need some statistics to see if this initiative is worthed the effort. Is there anywhere where we can get the statistics on the language of the students&#8217; parents ?</p>\n<p>-Extend finantial aid to International students, who currently do not have such right. Diversity and multiculturalism is a great part of the RISD&#8217;s image and success. There are many talented people out there who just need a little finantial push to come over (or stay) and share (or keep sharing) their perspectives, ways of thinking and, of course, their artistic skills. Any institution, large of small, starts to decline when fresh, new and radically different perspectives die out. Hopefully this won&#8217;t happen to RISD!</p>\n<p>Thanks you again!

Where is it? When is it???</p>\n<p>For the past three years, along with many other educational institutions across the country, The Rhode Island School of Design has celebrated September 17th as Constitution Day. On September 17, 1787, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention met for the last time to sign the United States Constitution and presented it to the American public. Constitution Day is a day to recognize, appreciate and pay homage to the fundamental principles upon which the democracy of the United States was founded. Former programs have included a faculty colloquium examining the judicial system and changes affecting the art community, a lecture by the Director and Librarian of the John Carter Brown Library and former Bill Clinton speechwriter Ted Widmer, and a visual presentation by Steve McDonald, RISD&#8217;s legal council, entitled &#8220;Drawing outside the Law: The Constitution and The Arts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year, in the tradition of recognizing Constitution Day, RISD will be hosting a live community reading of the Constitution at The Fleet Library. All members of the community are welcome to participate, and are invited to stop by the library anytime between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. You will be able to read anytime you arrive, for a brief or longer time, as you choose. Copies of sections of the Constitution will be presented in numerous sections upon a long table in the rotunda of the library. Choose a part of the Constitution that is meaningful to you; a sentence, a paragraph, a page or more. It will be possible for more than one person to read at the same time, as there will be a number of copies available. The reading will be video recorded. All regular activities within the library will continue as usual. Please come and have your voice be part of RISD&#8217;s voice on this important day!</p>\n<p>For more information, please contact Anj Shaw in Academic Affairs at jshaw01@risd.edu, or come to the library and take part in the reading.  Or just come and listen.</p></div>",

The other is about the first European ships which visited Tierra del Fuego. The Tierra del Fuego Indians had no concept of how such large vessels could be made or could exist, and therefore when they saw the first Europeans arrive on their shores, they thought they had come from nowhere, because they literally could not &#8220;see&#8221; the huge ships that were anchored in the distance.

You see it used in odd places here and there &#8212; on a bento box wrapper, or as the name of a Japanese restaurant, or even in the popular Styx song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2i85BnZ3WQ&amp;feature=related\">Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto</a> (okay, I&#8217;m showing my generation again).  </p>\n<p>The other way, and less popularly known, is to say <i>sumimasen</i> which literally translates to &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; In Japan the use of <i>sumimasen</i> adds up to at least 80% of the expression of thanks in Japan. It comes from the recognition that you have put someone else in a situation of inconvenience, and you are thanking them by saying &#8220;thank you&#8221; as something more to the point of: &#8220;I&#8217;m (we are) sorry that you have gone through so much inconvenience. I (we) thank you for your personal (or organizational) sacrifice (on behalf of yourself or the organization).&#8221; </p>\n<p>If others have some international stories about the words &#8220;thank you&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; and the interesting connection that these two phrases have &#8230; I&#8217;d love to hear them. </p>\n<p>In any case, <b>THANK YOU</b> to everyone that made last week&#8217;s opening ceremonies here at RISD be at least on par, and in many cases rivaling <i>in spirit,</i> with the opening Olympic ceremonies in Beijing! And the deepest <i>sumimasen</i> to all of the people that contributed to making the week a fantastic Convocation, Orientation, and Inauguration experience for our RISD!</p>\n<p>Best regards, John</p>\n<p>PS And special thanks to the RAs pictured above that ran with me last week early in the morning, and a special <i>sumimasen</i> for making you guys go up a few of the hills on campus with me.</p></div>",

While I value a distinction between business thinking and design thinking, a product or object which never makes it to its end user is incomplete. An understanding of how things get out there, and do well, is often a missing link. Stepping out into the real world is often a dreaded thing, and I would personally value any efforts toward making it a place to apply ones skills, rather than re-configure them.\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;ve been checking in with this blog, but I haven&#8217;t had anything to add until now. </p>\n<p>It think an entrepreneur&#8217;s organization is essential at RISD. When it comes down to it, all of us are basically tradespeople, and we will have to market our skills when we leave, if not sooner. The only problem is getting people involved and starting it up, which can prove difficult.  I think that this needs to be integrated into course curriculums and professors need to be more integrated with students. Several departments have classes with a lecture component- why not bring in guests from outside, or focus not just on craft but application?</p>\n<p>I attended the graphic design portfolio reviews last week, and it was absolutely invaluable. So many students didn&#8217;t go because their professors didn&#8217;t want them to miss class. Many more expressed that they didn&#8217;t feel ready to go to a professional review because their work wasn&#8217;t &#8220;real.&#8221; The biggest misconception at RISD is that the classroom is a vacuum. Our class work is essential to the outside world, and vice versa.\n</p><p/></div>",

Today I met a few RISD supporters and also a famed alum David Wiesner (he won 3 Caldecott medals). We had a chance to talk about RISD from his perspective as a grad. I told him about this blog &#8212; to which he responded like most people: &#8220;Everyone will expect you to solve every known issue at RISD.&#8221; To which I smile and reply, &#8220;I can&#8217;t address the wishes of 4000+ people perfectly &#8212; but to start I can at least listen.&#8221; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing here. Thank you for providing insights here &#8212; they are invaluable to me.</p>\n<p>Before I take off I wish to provide the underlying paradox as you all have posed in different language: if you graduate RISD ready to take on a specific job X, then your utility in a few years diminishes because you were trained for X only; whereas if you are trained broadly, it might be awkward to get job X, but you avail yourself to jobs A, B, C over a twenty year span of your future life. Trade schools train you for a job; college should train you for a lifetime of learning. You need both to win the game really.<br/>\nRoger Martin&#8217;s new book &#8220;The Opposable Mind&#8221; talks about Integrative Thinking as the key to intellectual longetivity in this century.

It&#8217;s a simple decision to just go ahead and do it.<br/>\nSo often in studio and in the general student body I see people overworking themselves for the sake of overworking themselves, because it&#8217;s just how it is at RISD. If you properly utilize your working time, you&#8217;ll probably find you have plenty of it. I&#8217;m tired of people saying they don&#8217;t have a spare hour to check out a lecture or hang out with friends- I guarantee you are not fully booked up all 24 hours of every day. If given a month to do a project, RISD students will spend that entire month. If given a week, they&#8217;ll spend the week- with similar results to a month long project. Cut OUT the extra, unnecessary time and you will find endless possibilities.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I was at a Faculty Meeting at MIT maybe 5 years ago where there was a study mentioned involving Tufts  and a few other top schools that showed a consistent pattern of chaos for most students especially in their freshmen year due to not having sufficient time management skills. The hypothesis was that since most parents of overachieving children today have tightly programmed &#8220;violin practice&#8221; and &#8220;SAT prep&#8221; and &#8220;soccer practice&#8221; and <i>&#8220;insert overachiever activity here&#8221;</i> that when freshmen arrive on campus they have lost the strict time schedule they once had. And since for the pockets of time they now wholly control themselves there is no constant external &#8220;pacemaker&#8221; to keep them on schedule. I don&#8217;t know how much of a generalization this is, but I do know that my own children&#8217;s lives seem quite programmed by many external events that have been arranged for them. </p>\n<p>At RISD I see some students that have mastered how to control their own time, and others who are just still learning. It can be frustrating to want to do everything; and yet we know it is physically impossible. The principle of being able to say &#8220;no&#8221; is critical, and yet we know is difficult when you are a right-brained thinker &#8212; intrinsically fueled by the positive energy of &#8220;yes.&#8221; When I encounter people who tell me they refuse to visit this blog, I totally get and respect their desire to abstain. They are making a choice in how they want to use their time.</p>\n<p>Managing time is difficult, and I&#8217;ve read most books on how to do it. Yet I find so many new ways that people manage their time here at RISD like counting in seconds vs minutes. I feel the list can go on and on. I like Mr Vamos&#8217; point about being ideas-centric when choosing how his time is invested. Anon1:04 essentially says that the activity you do will always expand to the amount of time that you have. Deadlines are an important construct in life, and yet the word itself &#8220;dead line&#8221; seems a bit negative when you think about it carefully.</p>\n<p>One trick I&#8217;d like to add to the pot is to simply live a longer life. The longer you live, the more time you will have to do great things &#8212; so take care of your body!  Eat vegetables, drink lots of water, exercise regularly, and indulge yourself only on occasion.</p>\n<p>This blog (two.risd.edu) is a special place to bring our ideas and hopes together as a community. Thanks to all who make a choice to contribute or even to just peek. And to those who don&#8217;t visit and choose to manage their time differently, as I like to say &#8212; &#8220;it&#8217;s a free country.&#8221;\n</p><p/></div>",

This is what the professional staff in the Division accomplish here on campus.  Residence Life, Student Life, Student Development, Multicultural Affairs, &amp; Health Services.

Along with Career Services and Dining Services we work in concert with faculty support to make the college experience as engaging as possible.</p>\n<p>It sounds weird, but students here need to get a life.  Not using the term in the negative sense but as Jef said, take advantage of the city in which you temporarily live.  There is a lot out there that can influence your art &amp; design.  There are many students here who have not grabbed on to that opportunity.  Your college experience is very short and is &#8220;free time&#8221; that you will never experience again in life (that is unless you go and get another undergraduate degree).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very true that companies are looking for &#8220;well-rounded&#8221; people to hire.

They start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actually goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consolidate their &#8220;discretionary&#8221; time into the largest possible continuing units. This three-step process:</p>\n<p>&#8226; Recording time<br/>\n&#8226; Managing time<br/>\n&#8226; Consolidating time</p>\n<p>is the foundation of executive effectiveness.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What Drucker is basically saying is: 1) that you need to take stock of how you use your time in an objective sense (i.e. draw a chart for any given week for where you invest your time), 2) try to throw out things you know aren&#8217;t a terribly good use of time (we know this to be hard as a creative person, as often the &#8220;mistaken&#8221; use of your time can lead to something wonderful), and 3) make sure you can arrange your time so that long swatches of uninterrupted task-time can be created (something that&#8217;s really hard in this age of instant messaging, cell phones, etc.). If anything the key takeaway is #1 &#8212; examine how you use your time. It&#8217;s quite revealing. Same can be said about your dietary consumption, etc.\n</p><p/></div>",

He had some interesting, and funny things to say to the graduate students, that made me want to comment today. What struck me the most was his comment on &#8220;bad teachers.&#8221; (so maybe this thread could be called Bad Teachers). He said that the grad students in education here might become good teachers, but some might be bad teachers and that&#8217;s okay. I have always thought that bad teachers are not okay, because what they do is turn off student learning &#8211; poof, system shut down.</p>\n<p>Well, here are my personal thoughts on &#8220;good&#8221; teaching, with some comments, and I hope others will join. I hope people will also clarify when they&#8217;re talking about learning and teaching young adults and adults as compared to teaching young children because I think the issues are different.</p>\n<p>1. Good teachers look at student&#8217;s minds as multifaceted and evolving like crystals growing in many directions at once. They know that we use both the left and right sides of our brain, and these need to grow together. John said that when he asked parents last week why they are sending their children to RISD, many said it was so their kids learn to be innovative thinkers. In k-12 edu-speak, that translates as &#8220;creative thinkers.&#8221; Innovative/creative thinking involves the power of right brain thinking and employers are respecting that type of thinking these days, says John. Good teachers balance creative thinking (right brain) with skill development and analytic thinking (left brain). The challenge with young children is that they are born great innovators/creative thinkers. In teaching young children, the question becomes how to focus that creative energy, not kill it. (My 4 year old son is the most brilliant inventor of the 21st century)</p>\n<p>2. Good teaching does not involve brain (right or left) thinking only. Good teachers speak from their hearts and teach from what they love and care about. One time a student asked a yoga instructor why he sits on a raised platform to teach, he said &#8220;so you can hear what I&#8217;m teaching from my heart.&#8221; Good teachers care about each and every student, and are passionate about what they&#8217;re teaching.</p>\n<p>3. Good teaching involves an ability to communicate directly, honestly and respectfully to the students. A good teacher can break down a thought, idea, or skill in a way that is clear for the individual student at his or her level.</p>\n<p>4. Good teaching involves creating clear and high expectations for the obligations of the student and the teacher. This could involve expectations for practice but also obligations to themselves, the people in the class, the community and the world. In Judaism there are prayers for almost everything you do, to remind you to be do your obligations, be respectful, help heal the world.</p>\n<p>5. Good teaching involves constant practice on the part of the student and the teacher. As Houdini said when asked how he became a great escape artist &#8220;Practice, Practice, Practice.&#8221; Good teachers are also practicing professionals. So in the case of art and design teaching (at all levels) they are always practicing their art and design and identify as &#8220;artist educators&#8221;</p>\n<p>6. Know that when you teach you also learn. The greatest artist/designer is one who teaches/mentors and passes on his/her art to others. Unlike the common adage &#8220;Those who teach can&#8217;t do,&#8221; the good teacher as John (I think) said last night are &#8220;those who teach do.&#8221; I think this means that &#8220;when you teach something it becomes yours&#8221; In yogic practice, the gurus say that everyone should teach and that is how they become great yogis. By reaching out to others, you better know what you think.</p></div>",

As I have learned from evaluations, the same thing that some students praise you for can be disliked by others.

At RISD, and most educational institutions, the teacher&#8217;s professional practice&#8211;as an artist, designer, writer or scholar in our case&#8211;and service to the institution &amp; community are significant commitments which are not easily separated thoroughly from teaching nor, in my opinion, should they be.</p>\n<p>Teaching is not necessarily about teaching a body of knowledge, or even methodologies.  It is sometimes simply stepping out of people&#8217;s way, and letting them learn.  When I&#8217;m asked the old question about great teachers in my past, I always have difficulty.  I don&#8217;t think females of my generation were mentored at university.  I had lots of good teachers who simply let me learn, in my own way, especially at graduate school.  If I did have to name a good teacher, it would be someone from very early in my life, who wasn&#8217;t at all glamorous, but who had color &amp; music in the classroom and brought us outside to garden.  Nothing was more riveting to me than a bulb in the palm of my hand, packed with mystery.  My teacher&#8217;s lasting gift to me was the smell of earth, though she never mentioned or described it, or even knew what I had taken away.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s excellent and necessary to develop and improve teaching skills, and I have a diploma in Higher Education and did the Sheridan Center&#8217;s Certificate Program 1 last year.  I do consider myself my children&#8217;s teacher, as well as mother.  I don&#8217;t consider myself my students&#8217; mother but do think that my professional practice as a writer, and my service as a member of this community, and my personal and civic responsibilities are linked in interesting and useful ways.  Again, what I would like to be able to do is to unfold possibilities for my students which some of them might like to take away.  On one of my syllabi this year, I have  a quote from Walter Lewin, Professor of Physics at MIT:  &#8220;It took me a decade to come to the realization that really what counts is not what you cover, but what counts is what you uncover.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>But I know I&#8217;m straying away from the topic of bad teaching!  Even though it&#8217;s not politically correct, deep in my heart I want to be a really bad teacher!  I&#8217;m sure I achieve that frequently.  I suppose too, there is a difference in types of learning.  Some things I want to pursue on my own, to wander and think.  Some things I need to know, I need to be shown, I need someone to virtually put my hands where they need to go.  One of the greatest things teachers can do is to empower learners to state what they need &amp; then to meet those needs.  But that is the Heavenly School of Art &amp; Design.  Then there are teachers &amp; students who point out the new or unexpected.  There are plenty of those at old RISD.\n</p><p/></div>",

They should laugh with their students and share stories with their students but most importantly learn from and with their students. I had great teachers who could teach me when it was time for learning and joke around when it was time to have fun. My favorite teachers, however, were the ones who could make learning fun, the teachers who could construct learning experiences that would teach me something about myself.

        "content": "<div><p>Notes (for those who attended, please add more information to fill in the holes):</p>\n<p>Undergrads and grads from across 12 different departments came to our get together in the RISD Store at 9PM. The gathering ran until 10:30PM. </p>\n<p>Aaron Perry-Zucker opened the meeting and thanked the various students and staff for coming to the conversation circle. Students began to share their RISD experiences in an unstructured and organic way. </p>\n<p>Two freshmen related how they were at the pre-college program before, and noted how suddenly they no longer had a curfew and how weird that felt. Suddenly they could do anything they want! A senior then remarked how she was approaching her last undergrad year at RISD and feeling like &#8220;I&#8217;m going to graduate soon &#8230; what am I going to do?&#8221; Provost Shefrin noted that it was interesting how at the beginning of the RISD experience your pathways appear wide open, and yet at the end you feel that the pathways are closing in on you. And how life always feels like that when you begin a new journey and go on to a new one.</p>\n<p>A sophomore shared his feeling that he began the year and asked out loud, &#8220;Where did everyone go?&#8221; Referring to the fact that the freshman year is so close and tight knit and bonding. And yet when sophomore year comes, then everyone splits off and goes into their own different domain. &#8220;Where did everyone go?&#8221; The answer appeared, &#8220;Here.&#8221; In the sense that there were folks from all types of disciplines sitting in a circle &#8212; perhaps just like that feeling one has their freshmen year.</p>\n<p>A senior in photography offered to anyone there in the circle to call him on his mobile phone as he wanted to give a tour of the photography facilities. He felt that it was those informal connections across disciplines that made him proud to be a part of this unique community. &#8220;I learned how to oil paint (badly) by hanging out in the Memorial Hall studios &#8212; through osmosis.&#8221; </p>\n<p>There was a conversation strand about &#8220;scattered brain&#8221; &#8212; the idea that if you are a &#8220;Jack of all trades &#8212; master of none&#8221; &#8230; is this an okay thing? The concern was seconded, and thirded. I explained to the circle that I&#8217;ve spent all my life as a generalist across many fields &#8230; and that I was hungry to learn even more new things. The broader the base of skills you have, the more versatile of a background you have to solve issues in new ways. A grad student agreed as he said that his undergrad education had no majors and his base was entirely broad &#8230; and yet because of his breadth he said he could do things in glass that nobody else could even imagine. It made me think about how <a href=\"http://lawsofsimplicity.com/2007/10/31/the-purpose-of-human-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;imagination is more important than knowledge.</a></p>\n<p>One 5th year Arch student commented that she came to this particular event because it was unplanned and also did not state a specific goal or topic. She said she came because she was curious what an event could be. It turned out that the event was about <i>us</i> &#8212; a perfectly valid topic to discuss.  </p>\n<p>Will McLoughlin, head of the undergrad Student Alliance, noted how he usually runs meetings and never gets to participate in one. He noted how through this experience he could see things differently. Will related a story about when the BEB was flooded with resin fumes and everyone had to evacuate. He recalled being outside the BEB with all his colleagues in the middle of the night just standing there. And realizing that without everyone&#8217;s &#8220;work&#8221; &#8230; what were they supposed to do with themselves. That the artificiality of &#8220;work&#8221; and the reality of a bunch of humans collectively outside without &#8220;a purpose&#8221; &#8230; was an odd experience for him to feel. This reflection was a powerful one.</p>\n<p>Jessica Roundy, head of the Grad Student Alliance, noted how proud she was to be at a gathering that brought together so many kinds of voices as well as undergrad/grad voices together. She felt that the whole point of having any kind of &#8220;alliance&#8221; was to create community &#8230; and we all felt it.</p>\n<p>The theme that came out of the event, in my mind, was &#8220;healthy social communities (HSC)&#8221; &#8212; that exposure to such communities on campus for students is key because they&#8217;ve left one of the most fabulous HSC&#8217;s out there &#8212; which is their own families. You can get your HSC inside your own department, you can get it from hanging out in one of the residence hall common areas, you can get it from joining a great student club, and you can get it from coming to a random 9PM event. A healthy social ommunity begins with a healthy outlook on the benefits of community. And the benefits of such a community are simple: sharing the human experience with one another.</p>\n<p>If I can remember more things that happen, I will add to these notes.\n</p><p/></div>",

While at IDEO, I was always working in teams with people from completely different backgrounds, and certainly none with the same &#8220;expertise&#8221; as mine.  That understanding formed the strong basis for being able to tackle any design problem out there, as long as that team makeup was well-crafted and considered.  For all of our scattered-ness, our affinities for other disciplines grew the broad top bar of our &#8220;T&#8221; brains.  And though it was less obvious, those connections pushed our depths of knowledge deeper, with reinterpretation and provocation from what seems like left field.  </p>\n<p>A &#8220;jack of all trades, master of none&#8221; implies a sense of inactivity that I&#8217;d argue against.  I much prefer to think of the acquisition of knowledge as a trajectory - you&#8217;ll be bouncing off of a lot of different surfaces and places to get to the Next Thing.  For me, it was coming from an obsession with dollhouses and drawing, to architecture and marketing classes in a techie institute, to the discovery of interaction design, to living nomad-like throughout Europe &#8230; to thinking about how art and design education might look like in the future here at RISD as the Director of Innovation Partnerships.</p>\n<p>It may not seem like it now, but there is value for this type of broad thinking out there.

So he pointed to someone around the circle and asked &#8220;Where are you at?&#8221; Then he asked a freshman, a sophomore, a junior&#8230; and then I think we realized that no mater what year we were, we could all give the same answer with different words.

The conversation was so fluid and I felt that people were really comfortable to open up and talk about their place here at RISD. It isn&#8217;t often that people can spend time to just sit down and talk, and listen to one another with the craziness of studio and everything we do. And that is probably what helped make the conversation so great.</p>\n<p>I was really taken by the comment by Jessie that it was a simple act to come that night to the RISD store. And in that simple act there was action. Really cool. I&#8217;m so used to such formal systems of taking those acts and making action and churning the wheels to find solutions. Jessie really made me think of a different, less formal perspective.</p>\n<p>In fact, the informality of it all was inherent in all the leadership from each person that night. We saw a part of what really makes RISD students, and therefore, RISD, a special place.</p>\n<p>With all this everyday leadership that came out that night, I wanted to say here a special &#8220;Thanks&#8221; to the team that I am part of for Student Alliance - the seven people that form the Executive Committee: Charlie, Nate, Nate, Liz, Izzi, and Jen. These people are fantastic and bright peers of mine. Without them, SA would not operate as it does. We are a real team that works together. Their dedication to the organization, their willingness to spend their free time, and perhaps a good part of time that would normally go towards academics is something really remarkable here at a place like RISD.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m inspirited by all of them daily.</p>\n<p>So, Aaron, Jessie, John, and ALL, I&#8217;m looking forward to what this year can bring for all of us.</p>\n<p>will\n</p><p/></div>",

The sweetest music to anyone&#8217;s ears is the sound of his own name.</p>\n<p>4. Be friendly and helpful.  If you want friends, be friendly.</p>\n<p>5. Be cordial.  Speak and act as if everything you do is a genuine pleasure.</p>\n<p>6. Be genuinely interested in people.  You can like anybody if you try.</p>\n<p>7. Be generous with praise - cautious with criticism.</p>\n<p>8. Be considerate with the feelings of others.  It will be appreciated.</p>\n<p>9. Be thoughtful of the opinions of others.

My wish may well add to the tumult&#8211;I&#8217;d like if there was an ongoing, ever-changing not-for-credit RISD 101 course! I&#8217;d love to take advantage, even superficially, of a broad sweep of what RISD has to offer. I&#8217;d like to smarten myself up.</p>\n<p>      I cringe at the sight of my &#8220;new&#8221; syllabi. The content is new but the design? The &#8220;design&#8221; says 1990s! I&#8217;d like to take a 3-hour intensive class: &#8220;Graphic Design Basics for the RISD Community&#8221;!</p>\n<p>      I really need another class: &#8220;Build Your own Website in 3 Hours (or at least lay the foundations).&#8221; Is there someone here who can teach this, hands on?</p>\n<p>      Other short classes I&#8217;d grapple with my schedule in order to take would be &#8220;Color&#8221;; &#8220;What&#8217;s inside those TIAA-CREF envelopes (if you ever opened them)&#8221;; &#8220;Apparel for Teachers (!); &#8220;Principles of Interior Design&#8221;; &#8220;Hands-on Visionary Guide to Media in the Classroom&#8221;; &#8220;Desktop Publishing: Best Hardware, Best Software&#8221; (even this title dates me). I myself could teach &#8220;How to Write&#8221; (in three hours).</p>\n<p>      This is my shortlist but I&#8217;m sure plenty of people have pressing skill-related needs which this community of experts could begin to meet if we designed a space of exchange. (Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t teach &#8220;How to Write!&#8221;)</p>\n<p>      It would be great also to have a regular 1-hour set of classes giving views into each of the departments, and RISD history. Mike Fink, in my department, is a whole advanced degree-worth of such classes all rolled into one slim frame. It would be great to have a very social way of exchanging knowledge here at RISD as well as a set of more desperate, time-driven classes for the skill-challenged among us.</p>\n<p>      I kind of chuckle at Murphy&#8217;s dilemma: rehearsal at Brown or conversation with John: it&#8217;s an embarrassment of riches. And I&#8217;m totally down with the sleep thread: sleep is one of my own very favorite activities &amp; I just hate life when I sink into that gritty sub 5-6 hours a night zone. But it gets old to go from year to year here without really upgrading a range of relevant skills, let alone not enriching one&#8217;s knowledge and understanding of what RISD offers.</p>\n<p>      Is there a way for the accumulated skills of this community to potentially upgrade the skills of the individuals in the community? Is there a way for people who never went to art school or didn&#8217;t even know it was a possibility (like me) to gain access to rudimentary understanding through sophisticated teaching?<br/>\n      I don&#8217;t want us all stamped with the RISD brand but it would be great (for me!) if all the printed material I produced looked contemporary and intelligent in terms of design. Likewise all the hardware/media/programs I use in the classroom: I don&#8217;t think the teacher should be doomed to be behind the curve. RISD would obviously gain if a bottom-line lingua franca in some relevant fields were available to all. Sort of like &#8220;No RISDoid Left Behind.&#8221; Only no punitive measures.</p>\n<p>      It&#8217;s impossible to do it all but maybe there are elementary relevant skills which can be made more accessible to all through a planned and ongoing set of free classes. Any opinions? Too much? Or are people happy going it alone as it is?</p>\n<p>      CE already meets most of the needs I outline. But I&#8217;m thinking of a hammered-together set of courses, RISD 101, taught by RISD faculty, staff, &amp; students, and offered on a continuing, rotating, ever-refinable basis, for the purpose of sharing skills within this community, &amp; maybe lifting capabilities right across the board.</p>\n<p>      Mairead</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I sincerely appreciate your inclusion of how staff can play a role in this Mairead. It seems very often, the staff can be overlooked, and it&#8217;s amazing some of the talent that is out there. John just pointed out last week about Floyd Luton&#8217;s photography, something I believe too few of us knew about as Floyd worked day in and day out in the Facilities Dept. Floyd is so knowledgeable about a broad number of topics, but his body of work in photography involving the insect world and graffiti are actually fascinating- to the point where I think he should be publishing and showing his work- (and hopefully, someday he will!)</p>\n<p>RISD has a very diverse wealth of knowledge based right here in our community, and I believe the staff can and should be given more opportunity to share their work on an academic level as well. It is something unique and special. Many staff members carry Bachelor&#8217;s, Master&#8217;s, and Doctorates in various fields&#8211; and these folks should be given the opportunity to share their knowledge, whether be through a classroom format, risdpedia as Lucy pointed out, or workshop series, or by some other means&#8211; it would be nice to coordinate something. I know as part of my graduate experience, I taught a student leadership preperation course which was credit bearing, with topics that ranged from Multi-cultural issues and Social Justice in today&#8217;s American culture to very basic Communication courses, highlighting topics such as public speaking and debate. I am longing to get back into the classroom to teach again, which I love doing. I love Higher Education and the impulse of electric energy that flows throw students. I love the &#8220;A-Ha!&#8221; moments I have with students now in my position with Residence Life. I am currently taking CE courses and am thrilled with the ideas I am being exposed to. I would love to work and collaborate with the faculty in other arenas as well&#8211; not so much as a division, but as a learning community, where the responsibilty of teaching and learning falls on all of us, and not just the burden of the faculty.</p>\n<p>Last year, i was able to work with some faculty on a big project called &#8220;The Major Cafe&#8221;. A group of dedicated RAs and I worked to invite faculty to dine in the Met with freshmen in the Quad. A number of Faculty and upperclassmen students came to talk about what their majors had to offer. The energy of that event was really amazing because it was a learning community in action&#8211; the energy in that room was overwhelming!! It was the coming together that made for such a successful event- and was one of the first times I truly saw staff, student, and faculty working together with a common purpose, and it was harmony, it was wonderful!!</p>\n<p>Anyway, my point is this: this community, RISD, has so much to offer. It&#8217;s special. Let&#8217;s continue to work together to make as much opportunity for learning , teaching, and sharing as possible.</p>\n<p>So the question that comes to my mind is: </p>\n<p>how and when do we start?</p>\n<p>This was a great thread to start by the way!\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello Chris, It&#8217;s funny that you say that because I realize that in 2008 I don&#8217;t know how to use Dreamweaver any more. I used to know it when it was &#8220;Dreamweaver 2001&#8243; but Dreamweaver CS3 has so many features that make so little sense to me. One thing useful to understand is the way that Adobe changed its product lines. It used to be that you could buy Photoshop and Illustrator separately. The cost of buying these was reasonable once. And then they acquired all kinds of companies making different tools and then started what&#8217;s called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;product bundle.&#8221;</a> Adobe recognizes that this is now a somewhat unfair strategy for customers that don&#8217;t know how to use their software anymore. So they&#8217;ve started anew with a strategy for the Web. Have you seen <a href=\"https://www.photoshop.com/express/landing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;Photoshop over the Web&#8221;?</a> It&#8217;s like starting from scratch for Adobe. A nice aspect of it is that it is free (or at least it was when it first came out). </p>\n<p>On the self-instructional angle, senior Adam Meyers has done a great job laying the groundwork for such a RISD-focused site at <a href=\"http://www.risdpedia.net/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">RISDpedia</a>. On another note I have a friend named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Weinman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lynda Weinman</a> that I have been talking with about the possibility some day of getting student discounts (Art Center does this for their students &#8212; Lynda is originally from Art Center) for her popular <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lynda.com</a> service which solves the perennial training problem that exists with all new software today. That&#8217;s maybe still a year and a half out from happening. </p>\n<p>Best, John\n</p><p/></div>",

The word &#8220;convocation&#8221; comes from the Latin <em> con</em> meaning together, and <em>vocare</em>, to call.  This event is indeed a calling together of people from many parts of the College to begin to create and recognize the community we are becoming at RISD in 2008.  There are many such ceremonies taking place all over the country right now.  This year RISD will have two beginning ceremonies: today&#8217;s, and later this week we will meet again to celebrate the inauguration of RISD&#8217;s sixteenth president, John Maeda.</p>\n<p>A calling together of this kind is an act of reciprocal invocation. The writer Lyn Hejinian has spoken about how &#8220;The community creates the context in which our work happens by generating ideas that might not come into being otherwise, and in the best sense by challenging everyone involved.&#8221;  A collective attempt at anything can be stunningly creative. Through creative acts the world is changed. What is seen always points to what is not seen, and reminds us of the necessity to keep the mind nimble and free in order to remain receptive to whatever comes back from the world once something has been put out into it. This continuing and dynamic reciprocity between the individual and the world helps build the foundation of community.</p>\n<p>About a year ago, I started taking a series of photographs from the point of view of tabletops; table sitting, table making; not house-sitting or baby-sitting but table sitting, seeing from the point of view of the table.  As we begin the school year and as this community begins to form, I have sat with many different groups:  department heads, deans, administrators and students - at many different tables in many different places.  I have sat with these groups as like groups and as mixed groups.  I have sat with people who have returned to the table many times, and with those who are here for the first time, brought by their commitment to their own passion - the vision that makes RISD what it is, and the desire to engage with each other in common discourse.</p>\n<p>I am aware that at these tables, in addition to being artists, designers, scholars, and educators, we are all social ecologists listening to and sensing the world around us, forming communities so that we can learn from each other about the many things that support us in the individual and collective work we do. Here are some of them:</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tIncreasing our capacity to envision new realties and understanding how we absorb and engage with the changing culture around us</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tOur willingness to engage with diverse and contradictory points of view</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tFiguring out what are the real problems into which we need to place ourselves, and what it means to put ourselves there</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tRecognizing the importance of beginning, and of acting, even, and especially when we do not know the outcome.   A famous Zen master once wrote, &#8220;The hand moves and the fire&#8217;s whirling takes different shapes.  All things change as we do.  The first word &#8216;Ah&#8217; blossoms into all others.  Each of them is true.&#8221;  Once we move, everything changes</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tLearning what it is we say YES to, and how we find our way to saying NO</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tWhat it means to live in a world of interdependent relationships while at the same time being true to our own experience.  Goethe wrote, &#8220;If we want to understand ourselves we must go into the world, if we want to understand the world we must go into ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tThe importance of cultivating a level of self-awareness and self-knowledge possible only by engaging in careful and disciplined critique.  Without a clear sense of self, one&#8217;s work may be technically proficient, but there will be no particular voice added to the world. James Joyce wrote, &#8220;All his life Mr. Duffy lived a short distance from his body.&#8221;  Many people live a short distance from themselves. One needs to know where one lives in order to imagine living elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&#8226;\tThe importance of paying attention to everything including the silent things of the world.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than making, all our acts of attention are acts of finding and maybe art is an act of finding before it is anything else.  Perhaps all that we can make together is the context or situation that will allow something to be found.  Reading and speaking are acts of communication and become the ways in which we find the words we need to make a clearing that can help us to know what we don&#8217;t know, that we know.  The words become a way of listening back to ourselves.  The words yield findings that might not otherwise occur.  Perhaps these words I am sharing with you today can be an offering for that clearing.</p>\n<p>In the end, if we are to do good and meaningful work we need to listen to all the voices at the table, in the streets and the city, across the globe, and in our hearts.  They remind us that what we do matters, that what we do has the potential to affect others, as well as the environment, and the potential to fundamentally change the systems in which we live.  As part of a living system and in order to be present to the work that we all do, we will need patience, wisdom, and respect for self and others to decide what needs to be done and when.</p>\n<p>The educational mission of RISD must drive the institutional vision as understood and practiced by the various components within the College.  As the chief academic officer of the College, my role is to help create the context and conditions necessary to support and enhance the possibilities within the educational arena that drive the passion, create the vision, and that continually reinterpret the mission in order to keep it relevant and alive.  This requires keeping the big picture - the 360-degree picture - which is, by the way, a moving picture, in view at all times. This larger view creates a lens through which one might come to understand all the components and the relationships among them.  This understanding is a form of knowing. (Thanks to Gareth for the button: &#8220;You cannot see what you do not know.&#8221;)  If these relationships are interactive and reflexive, they will help us to know where the passion comes from, what it is connected to and how we can use it to remain free and creative thinkers. This knowing is how we come to &#8221;see&#8221; and it is through this seeing that the community and the work come into focus and clarity is rendered, like a drawing being drawn. I believe that this is how vision is formed.  In this respect, the vision is made by us all and belongs to all of us.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start this year here and start as we mean to go, together, with respect and ready for the joys and challenges that lie ahead for each of us and for the community we are creating.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p></div>",

I would like to start a thread about the use of the fitness center. I have been with the department for six years now and I remember a time when faculty and staff could use the fitness center 24 hours a day. Public Safety had a sign out key in our office and anyone who wanted to use it could sign a waiver and go to the fitness center. Things have changed over the years and this is not allowed. We have to adhere to the constantly changing hours that the Office of Student Life assigns for the fitness center. Members of the Public Safety Dept. work 24 hours a day. Our job can be very stressful at times and some weeks we could work anywhere from 40 hours to 80 hours. Since some of us practically live here, going to another gym or adhering to the fitness center hours is nearly impossible. Our job demands that we take care of ourselves. We must always be prepared both mentally and physically to help and protect the RISD community. I know that for me going to the gym helps me stay healthy and helps relieve stress. I just wish that everyone in the Department of Public Safety had more time available to do so. At most other public safety departments, whether it be a college department or a municipal department, it is standard policy that their officer&#8217;s be allotted time to work out. We have a great fitness center here at RISD and its right above our office. It just seems a shame that we can&#8217;t use it. I would like to hear everyone&#8217;s opinions on this issue. Do you think that the fitness center policy should change?</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening,<br/>\nTony LeDoux<br/>\naledoux@risd.edu</p></div>",

The fitness centers as well as photo labs etc, were the best stress relief and performance enhancement systems possible and available. The spur of the moment and unsuspected threats to which you and your personnel must rise to eleviate are indeed stressful. Two weeks ago your personnel responded to a distress call by me, due an accident to myself. Their response was impeccable, assisting in medical attention and more importantly, psychological distress relief to me, (knowing that they were immediate, stable and unreserved or restricted in their capabilities to assist).  Persevere, with good arguement and negotiate your needs and position. There has to be some trust within Public and Private systems. BOL\n</p><p/></div>",

So when does confidence become arrogance, and when does humility become insecurity and inability to make decisions? All of these are so elusive, it doesn&#8217;t seem that you can come up with a single prescription.&#8221; <i>p. 45, TIME October 17, 2008</i></blockquote>\n<p>Later in the issue Michael Kinsley writes in his <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1851119,00.html#?iid=perma_share\" rel=\"nofollow\">essay column</a> on &#8220;The Leader We Deserve&#8221; (p. 68) on the theme of &#8220;ambiguity&#8221; as introduced by Prof. Gage above his own take on presidential leadership. Kinsley asserts that <i>empathy</i> is not a quality we need in our next president. That instead we need in our next president the following two qualitites: 1) astringency, and 2) intelligence. He describes astringency as, <i>&#8220;Astringency means telling people what they don&#8217;t want to hear and leading them where they don&#8217;t wan to go. It&#8217;s not comforting people about their current situation and reassuring them it will get better. It&#8217;s telling them that the situation is likely to get worse and that only their efforts can determine how soon it will start getting better.&#8221;</i> Kinsely describes intelligence in terms not so much &#8220;mystical intelligence&#8221; and more in particular he says, <i>&#8220;Call it intellectual curiosity, perhaps, or a willingness to engage with complicated ideas.&#8221; </i></p>\n<p>Lots to think about.

Senator Obama seemed, at least on one important occasion for me, to  exhibit the &#8220;astringent&#8221; quality of which you and Michael Kinsley refer.  Regarding the American low standings  in math and science skills compared to the rest of the globe, Obama did, on live tv, etc, inform parents to turn off their child&#8217;s tv&#8217;s, video games, and cells. This to me was an example of someone being honest on a culturally social point with huge ramifications. Sometimes humility is underglorified.

In short, RISD is a financially sound institution and we are positioned to adapt to the changing financial environment out there.</p>\n<p>You may have also read in the news that more than 1,000 educational institutions were affected by the termination of something called the Commonfund Short Term Fund, an investment account for colleges and universities.

The <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/risds-financial-situation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">letter</a> published at the beginning of this month is 100% fact. And if you personally have any questions wherever you may be, if you&#8217;re Staff then it&#8217;s important to speak with your Manager with any questions you may have, if you&#8217;re a Faculty person then speak with your Department Head, if you&#8217;re a student then speak with Student Affairs. Any emerging facts that I have as President are shared with my Advisory Council &#8212; each of the members shares facts with their organizations at their own regular meetings so that the information can be given life and the all-important ingredient to real truth &#8212; which is <b>context.</b> There&#8217;s only so much you can do on a blog and with letters. People are the best and most reliable conduits of information &#8211;- and I depend upon everyone in the RISD nation to communicate with their constituents. Ask questions, get answers, think of ideas, put them on the table. A tiny sample of the incredible RISD creativity and curiosity shines <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/10/16/operation-free-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">right here.</a></p>\n<p>As for the situation in the current financial world, we are all aware <i>together</i> that it&#8217;s incredibly unsettling. Last week I personally spoke with John Sculley (former CEO of Apple) and it was clear that someone like Sculley, who is tied to many key global leaders personally, is clearly stymied like the rest of &#8220;the experts&#8221; in the world. What does that mean? It means that we as a world are all in uncharted territory <i>together</i>. I want to note the emphasis on this word <i>together</i> because that is where we are. Not just one RISD. But also one world. </p>\n<p>The majority of my time awake is currently spent analyzing our finances in the context of global developments, and working with our extremely hard-working finances team together with the academics and museum components as represented by the Provost and Director of the Museum respectively. Will we find a way forward? There is no other choice. We will get through this situation <i>together</i>. </p>\n<p>Step one is to distinguish rumor from fact. Step two is to continue doing the great work that you all do every day to make RISD the one place on earth that champions the creative mind inimitably with genius. Step three is to know that we are working on understanding the situation with extreme diligence along with our colleagues around the world. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your help!<br/>\nJohn</p>\n<p>PS If you are curious and want to grasp the current context of the financial world, I suggest you watch <a href=\"http://www.poptech.org/juanenriquez/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this presentation</a>.\n</p><p/></div>",

Not only is business engaging this space with significance, but also consider the arena of intellectual property &#8212; which links directly with questions of commerce. </p>\n<p>To start I&#8217;d like to point you to some work by one of my former graduate students: <a href=\"http://meta-markets.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burak Arikan</a> that asks some questions about the meta-markets that exist in the creative space.</p>\n<p>Secondly I&#8217;d like to point you to the work of Larry Lessig with his Creative Commons initiative.

While that discussion moves forward, there are resources available for both students and alumni through the seminar programs we offer through Career Services.</p>\n<p>Students and alumni can attend seminars addressing entrepreneurial topics including: copyrights, contracts, forms of incorporation, business principles, licensing, marketing and promotion, accounting for artists, and panels (recent ones titled &#8220;Surviving As A Creative Entrepreneur&#8221; and &#8220;Working in the Arts&#8221;, for example) featuring alumni who are actively working as both artists/designers and businesspeople. </p>\n<p>Through other programs co-sponsored by RISD and the Small Business Development Center of RI and the Center for Women and Enterprise, students and alumni can connect directly to city, state and Federal organizations supporting the creation of businesses and providing access to a wide range of resources - including support for those with innovative products. </p>\n<p>You are right in noting these resources currently exist outside of the credit-bearing academic program - but the issue of entrepreneurial education and whether it resides inside departments, stands alone, or is developed in a way unique to RISD, is part of the on-going discussion. Input - from students and alumni, and from those in favor as well as those opposed to this direction - will help us to find an answer that works here. </p>\n<p>Changes in the last year - most notably, departments beginning to require students to complete an internship, credit-bearing internships available in all semesters and the summer, as well as strong departmental Professional Practice courses - represent positive movement! </p>\n<p>(Want to see <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/career_development.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">current seminars</a>?

The fact that our student population is mainly adults who are seeking to advance in, or start new, careers compels us to treat the business of art and design as part and parcel of the regular curriculum.</p>\n<p>To enrich the experience of students, as well as help graduates of our certificate programs to manage and expand their businesses, we have recently begun to program a series we call The Practice of Managing Innovation. Specific courses this semester include The Dimensions of Successful Innovation; Creativity, Marketing + Strategic Planning; and Introduction to Strategic Electronic Marketing. The winter semester will highlight Professional Practices in the Visual Arts, Marketing and Photographing Your Artwork while the spring will bring forth The Art of the Pitch and The Business of Art along with the aforementioned Introduction to Strategic Electronic Marketing.</p>\n<p>Of course, CE continues to offer all sorts of art and design courses that can be seen as professional development in general.

It left me with a couple of reactions.  First, that RISD should continue to think through the questions you raise.  &#8220;The institution must take responsibility for the financial success of its students, and it is in the institution&#8217;s interest to do so&#8221; is a provocative statement.  </p>\n<p>I also want to note that for better or worse, most liberal arts schools don&#8217;t accept business subjects like accounting, marketing etc. as part of the curriculum.  This is a ripe space for debate, as Steve notes.  Personally, I had a liberal arts education during undergrad (which I wouldn&#8217;t replace for anything) and then ended up going to business school because it was clear there was much about the ways the world works that I wasn&#8217;t taught.  This is not an uncommon path, nor one I regret; I doubt that I would have taken business classes had they been offered as an undergrad.  But it does raise questions about the options available at RISD and other liberal arts institutions.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Just a quick note, as this discussion potentially continues: business is not a liberal arts discipline, which I think may explain why liberal arts schools do not typically accept business subjects through transfer, nor offer business subjects like accounting and marketing in their curriculum. In fact, business schools are accredited by an entirely different organization than liberal arts colleges; humanities and business programs might exist side-by-side in a university, but they should not be merged, something that would dilute the intellectual traditions of liberal arts as well as the professional mission of business study. Given RISD&#8217;s unique divisional configuration, I understand the logic that non-studio business classes might fall into the one non-studio division (Liberal Arts), but I&#8217;d rather not see Liberal Arts become the catch-all for anything that doesn&#8217;t fit elsewhere. </p>\n<p>Having said that, I&#8217;m strongly in favor of developing business education&#8211;including classes and internships&#8211;in RISD&#8217;s curriculum. We need to brainstorm meaningfully about where and how that is to occur: a business program or division perhaps?\n</p><p/></div>",

Consider the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/business/smallbusiness/27shift.html?em\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent article</a> in the NYT which points out new entrepreneurial models that are now available to artists and designers worldwide. Courses are still not developed that speak to the new models emerging because the practices seem to change every day. One&#8217;s best bet is to simply engage in the world and to experiment with the practices now available to us &#8212; much of them are free to engage (blogging, photosharing, videosharing, e-galleries, auctions, etc). </p>\n<p>And my sense from talking with students on campus is that there are many majors that have &#8220;acclimation to the real world&#8221; courses that prepare our students for entry into the markets they may choose to enter. One I hear of is a course in Furniture Design that engages the topic of intellectual property and contracts; I&#8217;ve heard of a course in Painting that introduces students to the art market and how it works. There are so many things that exist in RISD that I believe remain undocumented. What would be helpful and constructive is if each department could list the courses that engage discussions on the economics of art and design. Can specific courses be pointed out by folks out there?

Dan is absolutely right in resisting any move to imagine the Division of LIberal Arts as a catch-all.  </p>\n<p>Equally obnoxious, to my thinking, is that young minds at RISD view their education in terms of divisions.  For example,m a student said to me recently, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t expect me to neglect my studio classes for a Liberal Arts class, would you?&#8221;  Well, I have many answers to that question, which I view as far from rhetorical.  Another student defined my class as a place to think.  To me, it seems bizarre to go to one building to make and another building to think.   The current structure of RISD, and the prioritization of one part of the curriculum over another, encourages students to understand their education in such a flat way.</p>\n<p>If the recognition of the importance of the economics of art and design, as evinced in this discussion, develops to the extent of curriculum, it will be interesting to see the character of that curriculum, and where it is sited&#8211;in Liberal Arts, or duplicated to a greater or lesser extent in many departments, or in a separate program, etc.  </p>\n<p>With writing, we have a mix of all this.  Our curriculum has been either modeled on writing requirements in colleges and universities generally, or has been developed in response to demand.  For example, we have  an introductory freshman writing class sited in the English Department in the Division of Liberal Arts; all Liberal Arts departments require writing in their classes; many studio departments require writing; graduate students write theses and have classes supporting that; we have a Writing Center.   In my own department, the Department of English, we have a range of writing courses at all levels and I myself teach creative writing (poetry), among other things, but we don&#8217;t have professional writing courses, and I&#8217;m not even sure that professional writing is the most current model here.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure either how relevant general college and university writing models are to RISD, where students are probably at their strongest as writers when they enter, and where they will not have a continued practice of writing over the next four years.  A required senior writing course might make more sense.   I&#8217;d be very interested in the proposition of designing writing courses specific to the curriculum of an art and design school; also in knowing more about the kinds of writing studio departments engage in with students.  </p>\n<p>An alum said to me recently that she would have loved to been required  to write arguments, or asked to write three pages about her studio work.  After English 101, in the first semester or first year, where is the site for such writing?  There aren&#8217;t any *writing* courses as such, as far as I know.  And if writing courses are developed, to maintain a practice of writing arguments, researching ideas, and articulating the preoccupations of students&#8217; work, where would those courses be sited?  </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not business, but I&#8217;ll be interested in how the economics initiative works out as maybe writing can follow.\n</p><p/></div>",

So many students that I have talked with (many of them seniors) are discouraged because they were not aware of these offerings until their senior year and they still do not know what else is available in our curriculum and in extra-curricular activities/organizations (as John mentioned above).</p>\n<p>Taking a look at the landscape of art and design colleges, I believe that with a heightened awareness around this new energy and a more structured approach, RISD can be the leader in integrating design and business thinking and again, prove that RISD is a place that understands the broader scope of the education its students receive. (I think we already do a great job at this.) </p>\n<p>Because of the special nature of RISD, many of the pieces are already in place. </p>\n<p>We are able to cross-register at Brown in classes on topics such as organizations, leadership, economics, entrepreneurship, engineering, (the list goes on). I think if we could chronicle student experiences in these classes we could create a peer-to-peer resource to educate the students on what is out there (and for that matter, what&#8217;s available here.)</p>\n<p>We also have collaborative studios with MIT and Babson that allow students to work with non-designers, MBAs, and engineers, preparing us for interactions with clients and collaborators after RISD and giving us the tools to understand and communicate more effectively in other venues.</p>\n<p>There are many cross-disciplinary student groups like better x design, engineers without borders, and respond|design that provide students with connections to the Providence community and other area universities allowing us to work on extracurricular and professional projects that we wouldn&#8217;t normally have the chance to.</p>\n<p>This is all amazing, but what we need to do now is finally make it a point to show our students in a clear and accessible way that these resources, courses and opportunities are available early on in their careers at RISD. Furthermore, I believe that RISD is in need of a resident advisor that can offer counseling and advice to students interested in making these connections in these fields. Too often students are left without guidance in their education beyond their chosen major (to the point that Mariead made about a two-tier perspective on education).</p>\n<p>This will ultimately allow RISD to nurture its interest and integration of business organically as an equal partner to the design and arts education offered to any and all interested students.</p>\n<p>This is all about opening doors that are already there. This spring I am pursuing an independent study on the integration of these two disciplines (collaborating with both RISD and Brown students) with the intention of using the results of my work (once completed) as the backbone to gaining a fuller understanding of creative leadership and a more structured integration of business within our community. </p>\n<p>Let me know if you are interested or have any input. I want to make this happen!</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time,<br/>\nWillem Van Lancker\n</p><p/></div>",

Design and Build is unique in that it is a two-component paid internship, and students may participate in one or both sessions.  We offer an installation internship in which students can work under the direction of an artist in residence to construct a land art installation for the Museum&#8217;s outdoor collection.</p>\n<p>We also offer a multi-media and performance internship opportunity in which students design and build sets, costumes, and puppets, as well as build models, and collect and edit film footage in a student run program. Both programs are supervised by MOA staff and resident artists, but are intended to provide leadership opportunities to the students and allow participants to cross train in all areas of the program.</p>\n<p>Please find the attached literature on the program and visit our site on youtube for program information. The link to the site is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/moautube806\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/moautube806</a></p>\n<p>We are hoping you will pass along the program information to your students.

Like short poetry, they are a challenge to craft with the same presence of their larger counterparts. Each exhibit brings in hundreds of powerful yet diminutive masterpieces for our jury to mull over. Inevitably we end up with a gallery full of diverse, compelling, and exquisite little gems. Manifest&#8217;s patrons eagerly await the Magnitude SEVEN event each year. So without further ado, we offer this call to artists to submit works no larger than seven inches in any dimension (any proportion). Standard presentation devices like mats and frames that are not considered part of the work of art are not limited by the 7&#8243; criteria.</p>\n<p>    Eligibility: Magnitude SEVEN is open to everyone. Professionals as well as students are encouraged to enter. The only limitation is that entries must represent original works of art or design no larger than 7 inches in any dimension.</p>\n<p>    Media: Open to all traditional and non-traditional genre and media.</p>\n<p>    Jury and Curator: Manifest&#8217;s selection process involves a complex two-part system. This exhibit will be juried by a 5-7 member panel of professional and academic advisors with a broad range of expertise. The jury will then pass along their recommendations to the exhibit curators who will make the final selections from the jury-approved pool.</p>\n<p>    Catalog: Manifest will produce a full-color catalog documenting the work selected for exhibit. Exhibitors will receive a 50% discount on one copy of the catalog. For examples of past catalogs visit Manifest Press. Discounted price is only valid through the close of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>    Delivery and Return of Work: All work accepted for the exhibition must arrive ready to install. Works not gallery-ready, or not exhibiting good craftsmanship, may be omitted from the exhibit. Accepted work that differs significantly from the entry images or suffers from poor presentation, will be disqualified. Work may be hand delivered or shipped. Shipped works must be sent in an easily reusable container/packaging with return shipping prepaid. Works will be returned in the same manner as delivered or via UPS/USPS. All work must arrive at Manifest by the specified date (see deadlines link). Accepted work will remain on display for the duration of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>    Insurance: Works will be insured while on gallery premises. Insurance covers theft, vandalism, damage caused by gallery patrons or staff (in accordance with insurance policy). PLEASE NOTE: Insurance does not cover damage caused during shipping due to any reason, including mishandling by carrier or failure of packaging to protect works in transit. Also not covered is damage caused to work by failure of the work itself, its mounting systems installed by the artist, or disintegration/degradation due to the nature/quality of materials or craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>    Entry Fee: Each work submitted must be accompanied by a $10 non-refundable entry fee. Number of entries is unlimited. Entry fee must be paid by check or money order made payable to MANIFEST, or by credit card via PayPal.

Unless academia is conferring this terminal fine art degree on anyone willing to pay the often staggering price for it, this devaluation of the degreed Master is indicative, we feel, of a systemic problem in society. The role of the master artist as cultural observer, intellectual mystic, and social healer is trivialized and misunderstood. Some suggest that an academic degree has no power to establish one&#8217;s mastery of an art form - that only hard work and trial by fire in the &#8216;real world&#8217; can do that. But these critics are, one might guess, those who either did not try, or could not survive the grueling critiques and endless all-nighters in the framework of the academic graduate process. Certainly, to say one is a Master is not to devalue other means of attaining excellence or status. But to have studied in the context of a university or college program, with rigourous requirements, and gained the terminal degree of Master surely warrants some merit. WIth this in mind this 3rd Annual Master Pieces will seek to present the best works by the best new Masters in 2009.</p>\n<p>    Eligibility: Master Pieces is open to current MFA/MA students or 2009 MFA/MA graduates.

This merit-based scholarship is intended for students who have a passion for art and demonstrate that passion in their work. Students using all mediums of visual art, including photography, digital media, and sculpture, are encouraged to apply. The program is intended to recognize and award young artists who exhibit exceptional talent. </p>\n<p>MYARTSPACE will provide three scholarship prizes for undergraduate students and three scholarship prizes for graduate students. First place winners in each category are awarded a $5000 cash scholarship. Second and Third place winners receive $2000 and $1000 cash awards, respectively. To be considered for a MYARTSPACE scholarship, applicants must be undergraduate or graduate students in an art degree program. </p>\n<p>Artists interested in signing up for consideration for a MYARTSPACE scholarship can find out more details by visiting the MYARTSPACE scholarship page. The application process is easy and straightforward. Artists simply register for a FREE membership at MYARTSPACE, where they can upload unlimited images, videos, and music.

THE FINAL DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION IS DECEMBER 16, 2009 . Early registrants (students registering before June 15, 2009) will be granted a 3-month free trial subscription to Premium Services, normally a $75/year package. </p>\n<p>Last year, scholarship applicants hailed from over 1,200 schools worldwide. Undergraduate winners included Sara Susin (Stanford University), Jessica Brown (University of Alaska), and Zach Stein (University of Kentucky). Visit the MYARTSPACE Scholarship 2008 Winners Page to see last year&#8217;s winning artist highlights, as well as the top 50 finalists. </p>\n<p>MYARTSPACE is one of the fastest growing and diverse communities on the internet. Its members include more than 50,000 artists, collectors, galleries and other art world professionals from across the globe, and it currently hosts the work of nearly 30,000 artists. Membership is free and artists can host their own art galleries with unlimited storage capacity. </p>\n<p>Catherine McCormack-Skiba founded the company in 2006. An artist herself, she notes &#8220;The Arts are an essential part of our society, and CatMacArt Corporation is proud to once again sponsor a meaningful scholarship program for young artists in undergraduate and graduate studies. A large part of the mission of the community is to provide opportunities for emerging and established artists to develop their careers . Given our record participation levels last year, we are hopeful that we can match the depth and breadth of the art submitted last year. It is a tough benchmark for us.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The scholarship program is one of several opportunities MYARTSPACE provides for artists. In the Miami Basel competition, winning artists have their work represented at the Bridge Art Fair in Miami, FL. The competition was juried by a world class panel, with curators from The Whitney, SF MOMA, and San Jose Museum of Fine Art. The London Calling competition offers artists an amazing opportunity to show their work at Scream London Gallery, a globally renowned art establishment.

The program is aimed at eliminating red tape and easing the use of the collections across these two campuses. Faculty, staff and students, with current registration at their home libraries, will be able to borrow books at each other&#8217;s libraries just by showing their IDs.</p>\n<p>Another feature of the collaboration is the addition of a search button for each catalog that passes searches seamlessly through to the other catalog. The <a href=\"http://providenceathenaeum.org/\">Providence Athenaeum</a> is also part of CHiL; due to the 10 years of <a href=\"http://library.risd.edu/\">sharing an online catalog with RISD</a>, there is reciprocal borrowing for Athenaeum members here, and for the RISD community at the Athenaeum. (Onsite use of the Athenaeum collections is available to the Brown community and memberships are encouraged.)</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the staff members at RISD and Brown who ironed out the details and are working to facilitate our agreement: at RISD, <strong>Claudia Covert</strong> and <strong>Gail Geisser</strong>; at Brown, Bonnie Buzzell, Steven Lavallee, and Bart Hollingsworth.</p></div>",

(ie, consistently do not show up for classes, do not complete assignments, etc) and are still allowed enrollment at RISD. Is it more important that a professor/department ignores problem students (and lets them complete their degree at RISD) so as to keep the number of students in the department up (looks good on paper), or is it more important that a professor/department have the integrity to dismiss the students from RISD?<br/>\nI know my answer, but I wonder if I am missing an integral view on the situation.<br/>\nThanks</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Sarah-</p>\n<p>John just pinged me about your question so I thought I would jump in. </p>\n<p>There are many questions in your question. There are many policies in place at RISD to<br/>\nhelp both faculty and students bring clarity to these kinds of situations so that everyone can ultimately use their time and energy in the best possible way to get the most out of being here and to contribute to the vibrancy and rigor that is at the core of a RISD education.  Rules and policies are necessary to help make sense of things and to keep the trains running on time but in the end everyone has to decide what they want and what matters. Careful not to assume that their aren&#8217;t other kinds of conversations going on that might have to do with trying to understand why someone isn&#8217;t able to take advantage of being here and why someone else might or might not make a decision to do something that you might not agree with or understand. Keep showing up and doing the work. Pay attention to what integrity looks like and practice it at every turn.  It will look different in different situations. If you have it and practice it, there&#8217;s a good chance your work will have it too. Thanks for asking the question in a way that provides an opening for others.-Jessie (Provost)\n</p><p/></div>",

I explained that we were waiting<br/>\nfor the others who had shown up on time to finish their breakfast and return to class.</p>\n<p>The following year&#8230;<br/>\nI decided to bring in fresh bagels and cream cheese for everyone for the entire semester.<br/>\n(My expense $360.) I thought, the early bird gets their choice of onion vs cinnamon<br/>\ninstead of  the last salsa/blueberry bagel After the first few weeks the class settled into the same old patterns of having some people arrive late.<br/>\nThe next year I brought in bagels intermitently, I found that it didn&#8217;t effect<br/>\na change in the attendance cycle.</p>\n<p>So now I do the cheaper smarter thing.<br/>\nI hand out the following  thoughts:</p>\n<p>Attendance<br/>\nShow up, and show up on time.<br/>\nYour classmates hate waiting to start a class, and immediately notice if,<br/>\nI stall to wait for a full room. Wandering in is insulting to everyone.</p>\n<p>You are mistaken if you think you can ask anyone, including me,<br/>\n&#8220;what you missed?&#8221;. I have witnessed enough classes and assure you,<br/>\nthat there have been the most arbitrary comments made, during the<br/>\nleast expected moment, that have caused me to reconsider the way<br/>\nI work or live.</p>\n<p>Give everyone the same quality of responses and the courtesy of your<br/>\nattention, that you expect for your efforts. &#8220;Art is the replacement of<br/>\nindifference with attention.&#8221;* (*Guy Davenport)  Practice this constantly. </p>\n<p>Lots of people actually have greater demands on their time and,<br/>\nare a lot busier then many of us are. Life serves up its surprises and<br/>\npart of your education is learning how to responsibly deal with an<br/>\nunexpected twist, especially if you are becoming a creative genius.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to complete an assignment, show up for class anyway.<br/>\nBring what you have, show what you want, but always participate.</p>\n<p>If you know you are going to miss a class, let me know as soon as possible,<br/>\nso I can advise you on how to remain current.</p>\n<p>The RISD attendance policy states that 2 unexcused absences in a Studio<br/>\nduring a semester are sufficient to justify, receiving a failing grade.<br/>\nFamiliarize yourself with the policy concerning a justifiable absence and<br/>\nthe appropriate documentation required for an absence to be considered<br/>\nas acceptable.</p>\n<p>So, If you are ambitious, driven, dedicated, and true to yourself and<br/>\nyour work, and the community of the studio, then this is as easy as it gets.</p>\n<p>(Epilogue: As a way to behave it is a &#8220;non negotiable&#8221; in my book.<br/>\nThink of it as catching a flight for the rest of your life, you either get on board or<br/>\nyou miss the flight.)\n</p><p/></div>",

Lateness, lateness coming back from a break, students going in and out of the classroom for unofficial breaks: all this is difficult to deal with in a highly focused class.  </p>\n<p>I think students sometimes have difficulty adjusting to the more compressed 3-hour period of Liberal Arts classes.  From my point of view, I don&#8217;t want to lose 10 mins from the beginning of class, another 10-20 mins tacked on to the break, and many more minutes reclaimed by students going in and out on unofficial breaks.   My job is to manage the class; it is every person&#8217;s individual responsibility to manage their time and bodies.   I don&#8217;t want to know too much about anyone&#8217;s coffee intake.  I just want to get on with the job.   I admit I&#8217;m Type A.  </p>\n<p>Lateness feels disrespectful.  It&#8217;s probably never intended as such.  One of the conundrums of teaching is the concept of the &#8220;class.&#8221;  The teacher almost invariably deals with a group.  How can individuals become a group in a useful and respectful way?  In education, there are many examples of how this can be done in a disrespectful way.  That&#8217;s easy.  It&#8217;s much more graceful challenge to have a thoroughly respectful classroom.</p>\n<p>Probably the most valuable thing to remember is that most students come to class on time and are respectful of the teacher&#8217;s time.  Provost Shefrin, then Dean of Graduate Studies, once gave me an excellent lesson.  What an opportunity, she said, when I was in despair about a particular class, in which only 4 people were at the table when class began: &#8220;You can give those 4 students the class of their lives.&#8221;  Teach with what you have.  Don&#8217;t overlook quiet students.  Don&#8217;t sell the students who do their damnedest to get to class short in your frustration with the few who don&#8217;t.  These are the kind of things I say to myself.  </p>\n<p>Also: there&#8217;s always a different perspective.  Yesterday, in College Building, I stepped over a student a few times: he was on the floor in the stairwell on the fourth floor drawing with charcoal on a huge sheet of paper.  It was actually quite hard to step over him: he was occupying nearly all the space between the stairs and the hallway.  Second time round I asked him &#8220;Why are you drawing on the floor?&#8221;  And he said, with a nod to the arched door below, &#8220;I&#8217;m drawing that.&#8221;  You have to laugh.</p>\n<p>There is a lot we don&#8217;t know about each other in this space of exchange, the classroom.  For a teacher, it is the workplace.  For students, it is school.  I&#8217;m full of admiration for students who interpret school as a workplace too: it gives us a meeting-place &amp; common ground.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Stephanie, </p>\n<p>Thanks for being interested. Here is the answer as succinctly as I an put it. RISD this year has an operating budget of about $124 million. We must have a balanced budget; i. e., our revenue or income must match our expenses or outflow. </p>\n<p>Tuition makes up the largest single portion of revenue, but there are other important portions like revenue from campus services (housing, dining, the stores), spending from the endowment (based on a formula to which we must adhere), annual giving, and interest on short term investment accounts. We need these other sources because tuition does not cover the full cost of a RISD education. </p>\n<p>From this aggregated revenue, we have to pay for a number of ongoing expenses. The largest is compensation and benefits for faculty and staff, which make up about 55% of the budget. We also cover other items, such as financial aid at 10% of the budget; interest on debt 9%; repairs, renovations, and equipment replacement 9%; utilities (electricity, oil, natural gas, water, sewage) 4%; and many other things such as insurance, food, library acquisitions, and instructional supplies.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that no one dollar of revenue pays for a particular dollar of expense&#8212;all of the revenue goes to cover all of the expenses. Decisions about the budget ultimately are hashed out among the President and the President&#8217;s Advisory Council with lots of input from many different people on campus. Ultimately, the Board of Trustees must approve what we on campus recommend as a budget before it can be implemented. Hope this brief description helps. Let me know.</p>\n<p>Arnie Yasinski, Executive VP, Finance and Administration\n</p><p/></div>",

So I&#8217;m glad a student asked <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/10/14/tuition-breakdown/\">how the budget works</a> &#8212; Arnie provided a succinct explanation of how it works and mentioned the <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/trustees_staff.cfm\">Board of Trustees</a> as the final approving body. It&#8217;s maybe useful to understand how that all works.</p>\n<p>We recently hosted <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/09/27/08-fall-trustee-meeting/\">a visit</a> by our Trustees and the photos just came back. Trustees are regular people just like you and me. They are motivated to be Trustees by the desire to engage in public service out of the spirit of volunteership. Some Trustees are alums and some are non-alums. </p>\n<p>A <i>trustee</i> is defined by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees\">wikipedia</a> as someone held to fiduciary responsibility for an institution. The role of the Trustees is not entirely understood at RISD, and I have been working to make it clearer for all parties concerned. To simplify, the Board&#8217;s major role is to hire/fire the president, to approve the annual budget, and to ensure that RISD is operating under sound financial procedures. In addition the Board is engaged in the full-time effort of letting the world know about RISD in the communities where they are active. </p>\n<p>There are many committees of the Trustees. Some of them meet regularly during the year, and others meet just when the Board meets (three times a year). There are faculty and student representation on some of the committees according to the RISD By-Laws (which is essentially our &#8220;constitution&#8221;). I am personally interested in an increase in engagement of the Board with our community, and we succeeded in doing so for the first Board meeting of the year by having Trustees engage with a record number of Faculty, Students, and Staff. </p>\n<p>If you are an undergrad student and are curious as to what happens on committees of the Board, I suggest you connect with head of the Student Alliance Will McCloughlin (wmclough *at* risd.edu) or grad Jessica Round (jroundy *at* risd.edu). Your engagement and involvement is welcome and appreciated. This is <i>your</i> and <i>our</i> RISD. Regards, John</p></div>",

I am confident many of RISD&#8217;s students, staff and faculty would benefit if we invested an effort in reviewing forms with a purpose of improving the efficiency of processing them. Although this effort could be accomplished by a forms tsar/tsarina, it should include input from those on campus who handle and process the forms, as that is where the time-saving opportunity and benefits  exist.  </p>\n<p>In order to make the case, some detail is necessary, I&#8217;ll indulge with a case in point: the &#8220;Change of Major Form&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>When put into use, this form&#8217;s design causes much time and frustration.  Students fill out the top of the form with their information.  If this section included a place for them to include a telephone number, tracking them down when necessary (with further questions or feedback) would be expedited.</p>\n<p>The middle of the form is the key problem: the middle of the form starts with the incoming department head and division dean signatures.  THEN comes necessary information which the department heads need to fill out.  This is counterintuitive, and sets up our busy teaching faculty who serve as department heads to err.  For over six years, I have attempted to find the secret to getting this form updated, because the percentage of incomplete forms due to this design flaw is high, i.e. the amount of time spent following up with departments to ascertain the information (ask them to readdress the matter) may seem trivial, but it adds up.  This also leads to delays in processing the forms. </p>\n<p>The bottom third of the form has no memorable flaws, as it is limited to signatures of the department and dean from the area which the student is departing.</p>\n<p>In absence of an electronic or interactive web form, which would provide feedback to students, all forms should include clarity to students concerning follow-up, e.g., check web-advisor, or identify to which office they should direct questions.  </p>\n<p>Many forms offer much more discreet opportunities to save time.  Improving forms where we can would enhance the quality of our work as well as buttress RISD&#8217;s customer service and morale all around.\n</p><p/></div>",

If anyone out there can call out the forms in their mind and describe it in terms of (1) and (2) we can get some momentum with this great idea. </p>\n<p>To contextualize, note that the famed <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/1350311\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;butterfly ballot&#8221;</a> is blamed for its poor design as a means to poll votes accurately &#8212; resulting in the ambiguous situation that arose in Florida with counting the votes for Bush v Gore.

It is a very powerful tool and we just use the edges of it.  (If I could draw, I&#8217;d insert a cartoon of a snorting and rearing untamed scary-looking beast, surrounded by a bevy of wondering RISDoids, thinking of how useful it could be but skeptical about our ability to understand and tame it.)</p>\n<p>The amount of time that is wasted on duplicate processes and resolving competing databases is dispiriting.  It would be fascinating to map out the path of a purchase requisition for a capital project, or a change of major form or application for readmission.  </p>\n<p>To use Colleague properly would require an investment in programming time, training, and a good report writer (with more training in the use of it).  But it would mean that departments could retrieve not only the data they need but information that could be useful that they don&#8217;t now get, and automate processes and approvals that now take far too much time and energy.  </p>\n<p>Through the stalwart efforts of Diane Walker and Peggy Lewis, aided and abetted by Nancy Severance in OIT and the cooperation of dozens of administrative support staff (there are candidates for your Doing Something Right thread, Candace) we are slowly chipping away at getting more of our processes on the Colleague system and accessible to our departments.  But we still have to deal with downloading data into Excel, distributing it, working with and revising it, and reloading it manually.  Running this through several offices using different platforms is challenging, to say the least.  Colleague should be able to handle this directly and also handle the authentications and notifications through tools like Workflow and Communications Management, but we need the spare time and setup/programming help to make it happen.</p>\n<p>What is most frustrating is seeing talented people spending their workday chasing paper instead of doing the interesting and useful stuff which computers can&#8217;t do.\n</p><p/></div>",

With the proper training, each user becomes more and more independent and able to do simple queries and are able to &#8220;explore&#8221; the data.  One thing I hear a lot about databases such as these is that people are afraid of &#8220;messing something up.&#8221;  Believe me, databases are built tough.

        "content": "<div><p>Renegade databases!  I like that Sheila! I&#8217;d like to add to the discussion and to the question:<br/>\n&#8220;What changes could be made to reduce duplication of efforts? How can we communicate better so we can share our solutions with each other so we don&#8217;t have to re-invent the wheel each and every time a challenge arises?&#8221;</p>\n<p>But before I begin, let me ask another question:  Where does the &#8220;definitive&#8221; demographic information about our students / faculty / staff reside?  Some would say Datatel &#8211; and I would suggest it should&#8230; While others may say.. On my personal computer, or perhaps on a laptop somewhere making it&#8217;s way from here to there.  Pretty scary.  (Hmmm. perhaps a security issue for another topic)</p>\n<p>Although Datatel is the major information system RISD has used for what - the past 20 years, to operate many of its major business functions, many other systems have grown up side-by-side, which support other college operations.  Over the past several years other (what I call side-car systems) have also developed, partially due to the lack of functionality of the Datatel system, partially due to the lack of training on how to use it, and partially due to the &#8220;convenience&#8221; factor &#8211;something like:  &#8220;I know Excel or I know Access, or I know Filemaker &#8211; so I&#8217;ll just use what I know&#8221;.  All too often, this permeates the duplication and causes errors in processing down the road.</p>\n<p>Recently I was working on the implementation of a new system, and I asked the user: &#8220;how do you move data from one system to some other?&#8221;  I almost fell off my chair as the user said, &#8220;I write it down and FAX it&#8221;.<br/>\nSo over the years, these side-car systems have developed in conjunction with some of the purchased business systems in order to operate the college. Many of them without any thought about data flow or business process. </p>\n<p>Ah Ha&#8230; you say.. So what&#8217;s the answer? Its time to consider a business process re-design, reviewing our major systems and determining more efficient means of connecting all the dots. The common name for such a process is called Identity Management or IDM for short. This IDM system sits as the traffic cop for all data flowing between system X, Y and System Z, and establishes a set of rules for processing transactions.  For example, a student leaves the college and we need to invalidate his/her ID card, remove from the Meal Plan, and generate a final bill, among others.  One transaction &#8220;could&#8221; trigger a chain of events and the IDM system would facilitate the communication necessary to make this happen between systems.</p>\n<p>Discussions are already underway, first, developing an accurate data flow, followed by establishing an appropriate set of rules for the implementation of such an IDM system.  Although this will be a major undertaking for OIT and the college, the potential for increased efficiencies, reduced duplication, reduced manual processing and help to eliminate errors is enormous.\n</p><p/></div>",

It has been discussed in committees and subcommittees, in working groups and brainstorming sessions.  It was discussed when the problem of alternate databases first came up back in 1985.  It was discussed when we had to implement a major upgrade in preparation for Y2K.  It has been discussed until the cows not only came home, but had a nice dinner, put on their jammies and went to bed.  </p>\n<p>Most recently a significant group of administrative computing users made a series of proposals for training help, and a group of academic administrative users has been working with OIT to help implement some small steps toward our goal of using Colleague more effectively.

Cicilline today announced that the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) has joined the City&#8217;s efforts to provide warm coats to those in need through the Mayor&#8217;s Annual Coat Drive.    </p>\n<p>&#8220;I am delighted to announce that the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) has joined forces with the City in making the Mayor&#8217;s Annual Coat Drive the focus of their annual holiday giving,&#8221; said Mayor Cicilline. &#8220;Our community has always shown its compassion in times of need; and this year &#8211; with a truly challenging economy that is hitting families hard &#8211; the university has stepped up to donate new or gently used winter clothing to our neighbors.&#8221; </p>\n<p>RISD officials have agreed to make the Mayor&#8217;s 6th Annual Coat Drive the target of their holiday charity this year.  In addition to the collection bins set up in city buildings, the university is setting up marked bins throughout its campus for garments, which will then be given to the City for Crossroads Rhode Island and the Homeless People&#8217;s Action Committee.  </p>\n<p>Additionally, officials of the 12th Annual Buy Nothing Day, held on Friday, November 28, on the State House lawn, will donate extra winter clothing to the Mayor&#8217;s Coat Drive, at the close of their event.  </p>\n<p>The Mayor praised officials from both organizations, noting that our community has always come forward in times of crisis to help others.  He reminded everyone that the recipient organizations have expressed an urgent need for new or clean, gently used (oversized) winter coats, hats, gloves/ mittens, boots, heavy socks and blankets for adults and children.  There is also a critical need for personal care items such as shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrushes, shaving goods and feminine hygiene products.  </p>\n<p>Donations may be dropped in marked bins at the following City buildings:  Department of Public Works, Department of Planning &amp; Development, City Hall, Building Inspector&#8217;s office, Public Safety Complex and the Providence School Department.   Collections will continue to take place<br/>\nthroughout the winter months.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Mayor&#8217;s Coat Drive, contact 401.351.4300 extension 627.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p/></div>",

In doing so, we&#8217;ve found a world-class service that is less expensive for RISD, gives students email for life, and best of all, much more storage. We&#8217;re proud to be a leader among educational institutions in making this switch.</p>\n<p>Understandably, some questions have come up since we&#8217;ve made the switch. OIT has been keeping <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/oitpages.aspx?oitID=15688\">a detailed list of FAQs</a> to address many of these questions, and we continue to add new questions and answers as they come up. There are two issues that I want to address directly here:</p>\n<p>1. As of now, only students are using Gmail, though we will be discussing the best way to migrate staff and faculty over the next year. We don&#8217;t anticipate this switch happening before next fall.</p>\n<p>2. We realize that with two different systems in play, it&#8217;s sometimes hard for faculty and staff to find student addresses in Groupwise. Rest assured that when students&#8217; old risd.edu addresses are shut down, <strong>planned for December 1</strong>, we are working to populate the GroupWise address book with the students&#8217; Google email addresses, solving this problem (ETA mid December 2008).</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find an answer on the FAQ, feel free to comment away here!</p></div>",

I&#8217;ve always felt that the museum does not reach out to the student population and that they are much more interested in alums and donors. This may not be true but it&#8217;s the little things that count. For example, before the public opening of the Chace Center, they opened the doors for members and alums, but there was no student day. Isn&#8217;t it our museum too? And why does the giant escalator go from the first floor to the third floor skipping over the student gallery?</p>\n<p>Anyways, those are my thoughts, I&#8217;m curious how other students/staff/faculty see the relationship with the museum as it currently exists.</p></div>",

Rafael Moneo is a genius in making architectural systems that flow &#8212; and as we know, it&#8217;s almost impossible to design any solution that resolves 100% of the issues of constituent desires, and cost.

In recent years the Museum has been committed to keeping admission charges for youth groups affordable, so the counselor was surprised at how easy it was to plan the trip.  At the time of the tour, our docent made the boys feel comfortable and treated them with respect, but she also let them walk where they wanted to walk and look where they wanted to look.  The counselor called me the next day to express his gratitude &#8212; and surprise &#8212; for the energizing experience his group had had with us.

The Chace Center was supposed to be a bridge between RISD and the community at large, but that can&#8217;t be achieved if no student opinions are brought to the process. Shortly after the Chace Center opened, I stopped in between classes to look at the new RISD Works store. A salesperson approached me and asked if I was buying anything. When I told her I was just looking, she asked me to leave the store. And just the other night, I passed by when some company was having a private gathering there, which is fine, except that the windows were completely covered up.

        "content": "<div><p>Well, maybe someone who was part of the planning needs to speak to the escalator issue. As is true for much of the building, it was a compromise driven by a combination of design and cost constraints. The original plan was to have the escalator stop at the first floor student gallery. After making several attempts, the architects concluded that the length of the run required to permit a stop at the second floor made it impossible without significant redesign and the necessity of making other compromises that would have taken away much needed program space in favor of circulation. They suggested a staircase to the second floor and pointed out that the rear entrance to the building leads directly to the student gallery and that there are elevators that will take visitors to the student gallery who don&#8217;t wish to take the stairs from the first floor. So, access to the second floor really wasn&#8217;t at issue. Getting people to the third floor was, so the escalator was kept in the plan because a staircase from the first to the third floor was considered too long a climb for many museum visitors. One of the major goals of the museum was to reorient the museum to face downtown and be more welcoming to a public that is often shy about entering college buildings. I&#8217;m sure there were also some feelings on the part of some that the student gallery belonged more to the RISD community and that the museum serves a more general audience, or I think another solution might have been pressed. I was probably the last member of the planning group to accept this compromise, but in the end I could not offer a reasonable, affordable alternative.</p>\n<p>My complaint about the Chace Center is that whether you&#8217;re a member of the RISD community or the general public you don&#8217;t feel you&#8217;ve arrived anywhere when you enter the building from Main Street. (Ironically, the rear entrance on the second level that takes you directly into the Student Gallery is the most interesting and welcoming way to enter the building. It&#8217;s protected, well lit, has a seating area and is warmed by the stone foundation for Memorial Hall opposite the entrance. I remember this was one of Moneo&#8217;s favorite features of the building site.) The first floor of the building needs to be more welcoming and celebratory for both the RISD community and the public. Members of the public include prospective students and their parents who come to discover RISD, not just the museum going public. Right now they are greeted by a gift shop and some empty tables and chairs. I feel that the best solution now to making the RISD Center more welcoming to all comers is to bring some of the character and spirit of RISD to the entrance level. From there, you can take an elevator, a staircase, or an escalator to continue your discovery. One of our first plans for the first floor space was a media wall, also one of the first things to be cut in reducing costs. I think it&#8217;s time to rethink that idea or come up with another solution that will enliven the entrance and make everyone feel equally welcome.\n</p><p/></div>",

It was not my intent to belittle what is obviously the one bright spot on the first floor of the Chace Center and a beacon on the street that attracts people into the building. I like its inventory, which does reflect something of the spirit of RISD. However, I would like to see more than a retail outlet serve a welcoming function. It could be as simple as a warmer, more fully furnished interior space or some display functions that point to the other attractions above in the student gallery and museum. I offer this not as a criticism of those who have worked hard to make this building work but as encouragement to continue to make it even better, a point of arrival.\n</p><p/></div>",

I did and what did I see?  A porn video version of the Republican candidate for Vice President, doing some XXX things, with her famous spectacles on, and nothing else, there in the lobby of the former church building: we stared and chuckled.</p>\n<p>But it really wasn&#8217;t funny, at all.  The majority of our student body is female, and many come to our shores from the wide world. Sure, our freedoms are grand, and art is immune to bourgeois considerations of propriety.  But this was a singularly insulting display, not the least because Governor Palin was not the winner in our recent election popularity contest, in a state overwhelmingly Democratic in its political record.</p>\n<p>Pretty cheap shots, easy pickins, and brought me back to the culture of my youth, with one toe still in Victorian times and tastes.  You show some respect for authority and position.  You maintain a degree of decorum from regard for the queen, and for your mother, and for all women.  You wanna watch porn?  Fine.  Don&#8217;t show it off for all to gloat at the noble entrance to our college.</p>\n<p>I have no idea who might claim credit, let alone responsibility, for this assault on Sarah Palin and her family and her Alaska community.  I did not find it an appropriate joke at this time and in this place. I&#8217;m not normally a stuffy soul.  In fact, &#8220;South Park&#8221; is my favorite T.V. show on Comedy Central, and Dan Savage gets my guffaws in the Boston paper &#8220;Dig.&#8221;  But I was revolted and offended by the witless churlishness of the unseemly humiliation of Sarah Palin.  And p.s. I liked her.  Not for her views, in case anybody cares, but just because I liked her.</p>\n<p>Some semesters ago, I noted some porn cartoons in the men&#8217;s room of the College Building.  They concerned a lady professor of a certain age. But, believe it or not, they were affectionate, light-hearted, even admiring, and silly.  See: I&#8217;m not prudish about what kids come up with.  It was the sheer ugliness, the total ill will, of the video of the governor, that I&#8217;m complaining about to, and, hopefully with, the RISD world within the reach of this kvetch.</p></div>",

I am going to post it in its original format.</p>\n<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>\n<p>    I am writing to inform you that I am profoundly disturbed by the recent events pertaining to the Nov. 4th show in the Memorial Hall gallery. As I do not think it is productive to simply complain on the streets and/or in the studios to my fellow painting students, I have chosen to address the situation openly and directly. I hope that, at the end of this email, my personal convictions on the topic will be crystal clear. I hope that, at the end of this email, a new discussion will take place. I hope that, at the end of this email, the recent events will be reconsidered. I am not demanding that they be reversed, just seriously reconsidered. I ask this in the name of productive solutions for handling the potential-situations similar to this one that will inevitably occur in the future.</p>\n<p>I believe that the 2009 painting class, in particular, has been actively encouraged to become politicized, to cultivate convictions, to question the present systems of &#8220;control&#8221; and to tackle tough issues, specifically pertaining to identity politics. Many of us have taken heed and are currently in the process of engaging with this complex and difficult trajectory of art-making. This task, as all of you know, is an arduous one. Sensitive issues abound, the expectation that our every attempt to engage a public will be flawless, perfectly articulated, and &#8220;right&#8221;, is one that is not only unrealistic but unproductive.</p>\n<p>We are students. We are students who are (presumably) invested in our positive contribution to the expansive understanding of something, somewhere. Dennis once told me that he described the department to our new president, John Maeda, as being primarily concerned with &#8220;making citizens&#8221;. And I couldn&#8217;t be more supportive of that sentiment. But is our freedom of speech not apart of this aforementioned &#8220;citizen&#8221;-ness? What does it say to us as young artists, about our rights pertaining to our freedoms of speech and expression (the very freedoms that we all depend on for any sort of cultural cachet), if, in the context of this &#8220;progressive&#8221; art school, we are met with heavy-handed censorship and punishment for our ideas and/or the manifestations of those ideas?</p>\n<p>I do not believe that it is the place of the faculty, or the student body, to decide whether a piece of work &#8220;deserves&#8221; to be shown or seen, granted the work is not compromising the direct rights or safety of others.<br/>\nI do not believe that the work made in this department needs to cater to an audience of parents of prospective students, conservative residents of the East Side, the weak-of-heart, those who are easily offended or those who dislike the things that make them &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221;.<br/>\nI do not think it is productive to discuss the subjective &#8220;success&#8221; of the work. I believe that speaking about the situation in those terms is a direct skirting of the larger issue.<br/>\nI do not think it is productive to attempt to discern &#8220;who&#8221; is entitled to talk about &#8220;what&#8221; based on normative understandings of gender, sexuality, race or class.<br/>\nI do not think that the students, the faculty and/ or the administration of this school should decide the fate of any piece of work based on personal taste, visceral reactions or Morals.</p>\n<p>Let us not forget that the things that are most profoundly disturbing to us are often instrumental in developing a greater understanding of just What and Why we believe a thing, event or action is utterly repulsive. With that clarified understanding, it is possible to develop an articulate stance on the issue. Armed with that articulate position, strategies for a (subjectively) more-productive way to address the problem can be implemented and a &#8220;change&#8221; can be made. No truly provocative piece of work is ever un-productive. Let us not delude ourselves.</p>\n<p>This community, this school and/or this country (as we have clearly seen in the past week) did not reach this current level of influence, progress and/or achievement by playing it safe, avoiding challenging issues or accepting injustice.</p>\n<p>The November 4th Show, in which I participated, was curated by a group of students utilizing an appropriate democratic process of work-selection. The curatorial group, comprised of seniors, who are about to enter a world where there will be plenty of resistance, deserve to jury their own (approved) show utilizing the discretion that they deem to be appropriate. I ask that they, and the future student-curators of the Rhode Island School of Design, be granted the full opportunity to publicize their ideas in an arena that is free from censorship.</p>\n<p>In the name of preserving the integrity of the dialogue within this artist-community, I ask that this situation will be reconsidered.<br/>\nIn the name of preserving the integrity of the dialogue within this artist-community, I ask that the censorship of student work come to an immediate and permanent halt.</p>\n<p>Most Sincerely,<br/>\nMaria Salas\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I hope to attend the discussion on Thursday. In the meantime I want to share two experiences I&#8217;ve had  that relate to this subject. Many years ago, one student made a piece for a self-portrait project that was a vinyl zippered mask on a wig stand. It had a plastic tube going from the mouth area to a propane tank. The unmistakable reference was to suicide. I decided I would not critique it and our class discussion began. I decided that I was unwilling to discuss the aesthetics of suicide. Most probably some members of the class had known someone who had committed suicide and it is a profound event.I felt that either this student was considering the idea, in which case I needed to help him, not critique the piece about it. OR he was dealing with something very serious in a somewhat trivial way. Of course the discussion examined what role &#8220;disturbing&#8221; has in art. And if disturbing and provocative has limits. If the disturbing aspect of a piece is its merit, then a shooting, a stabbing, a suicide bomb would be even more disturbing and provocative. Where is the limit? Inside of each of us I decided, and felt that I had a right to my own limits. Each of us does.<br/>\nOn another occasion a grad student did a presentation/performance in which she  drank whiskey (real) throughout her piece, and then brandished a revolver, putting it in her mouth several time. (Later she revealed the revolver was only plastic) Students fled the auditorium in terror and were extremely upset and angry to be manipulated in such a manner, unwillingly and unwittingly to be used. They were also livid that the teacher did not intervene, or follow-up, or even address the issue in the following crits. No limits.<br/>\nI am interested in your reactions and responses to these two events. What would you have done in each case?\n</p><p/></div>",

In the past ten years at RISD I noted with interest the discussions surrounding two instances when we had to negotiate the sometimes itchy divide between &#8220;censorship&#8221; and community values&#8212;both instances had to do with promoting events and the power of graphic design to offend. In the first instance students made posters to advertize an opening that used archival photos and text to what was perceived by many faculty and staff to be racist. The students who made the posters were ignorant of the posters&#8217; valence and agreed to talk with the offended parties and learn about how recent US race relations had shaped the perceptions of other generations. The discussion was a learning occasion for all: what had been for the students abstract historical information about what they considered dead issues taught to them in high school civics courses had been lived and albeit traumatizing and galvanizing for many faculty and staff who participated in the discussion. In the second instance the Sex Club put up explicit posters advertizing porn screenings and educational programs to which a student Christian group took exception. The initial Fall Semester discussions brokered between the two groups were quite uncomfortable but the respectful effort to mutually yield some ground laid the groundwork for some collaborative efforts in the spring semester, such as an AIDS benefit. Perhaps the point is that it ain&#8217;t easy calibrating the overlapping roles of citizen, community member, and creator so that the responsibilities of one role do not overwhelm all other considerations\n</p><p/></div>",

Well, actually, a pair of messages, one stuck on my door, the other emerging among my e-mails.  We met for coffee followed by a hug in the sunshine of Wickenden Street.  I see the project from a different perspective.  The assignment was to create political statements visually; the concept was not out of line.  (Not sure that I &#8220;approve&#8221; since my theme of the semester is precisely to avoid propaganda and slip away from anything opinionated and therefore closed)  But be that as it may.</p>\n<p>Philosophically, I cling still to the idea of the dilemma.  Freedom of speech is a fine guarantee of an open society, but, hopefully, its purpose is to protect human rights, not to permit violation of human vulnerabilities.  Don&#8217;t want to argue or debate here, the blog exists not for logic but for venting.  And I only want to say that I feel nothing but affection and regard for the student.  And to add that, personally, I would like to celebrate irrelevancy, even triviality, the quest for small pleasures and glimpses of what is deep within what is not deep, the passing but poignant moments of our brief lives.  Our culture goes in for shock value, in nearly all its art forms and forums, and I vote for the soft smile.

The piece should be displayed, however, it should be in a segregated area of the gallery, possibly with a warning of graphic material. This was the consensus I felt was reached at the discussion last Wednesday, but there are some other concerns the piece raised other than censorship and gallery space. I have some thoughts about the piece itself that I wanted to raise:</p>\n<p>I have been thinking about this piece of work since I saw it the morning after the election as I was walking to my studio in the basement of Memorial Hall.  My initial reaction was disappointment for the overt gaudiness of a victorious and supposedly &#8220;progressive&#8221; party revealing in its hatred for Sarah Palin and using sex as a weapon of shame and mockery. Considering that President-elect Obama won under a campaign slogan of &#8220;change&#8221;, it was insulting to his party and message for Obama supporters to ridicule the opposing Vice Presidential candidate with porn and sex dolls.  </p>\n<p>Since my studio is in the same building as the display in question, I HAVE TO walk by this piece almost every day.  Now, not only am I female, but I&#8217;m a transfer student, and I&#8217;m a (gasp!) Republican.  I&#8217;ve been trying to adjust to a new community, in which I am one of the very few conservatives on campus, in this city even, and I am daily reminded of the hostility towards the very few conservatives RISD has managed to attract.  The fact that Sarah Palin is female and conservative and on display in a gallery in a porn video with sex dolls can&#8217;t help but make me feel that that&#8217;s really how much respect RISD&#8217;s student body gives females and conservatives.  How is it possible for RISD to build a diverse community with this as its standard for respect of divergent opinion and background?\n</p><p/></div>",

In some cases like College Building and Market House the heating systems are original to the building and are quite old. In fact RISD has a back log of deferred maintenance of about $25 million. This is work that is required to maintain all the existing buildings and systems. RISD also has a backlog of about $25 million in modernization. This is work that would upgrade building systems to the standards and engineering of 2008. </p>\n<p>About half of the buildings on campus are supplied steam from the Central Power Plant via steam pipes running thru buildings and under ground. This system works well when it is consistently cold out but tends to be difficult to manage in the fall and spring when outdoor air temperature range from below freezing to the mid sixties during any one day.</p>\n<p>To fully explain all of the issues facing the campus here on the blog would be difficult.

While I do think that finding one&#8217;s voice and visual medium is the primary goal of an education here, I do not think that, dare I say &#8220;useful&#8221; design needs to be relegated to ID and Architecture only. Recently the Graphic Design Guild started up as a group of GD students looking to create some extra work around campus and take on somewhat more meaningful projects. I very excitedly joined this group, but even in the first few weeks of its existence there has been a shocking disinterest. Now just a handful of students participate.</p>\n<p>While I am not saying everyone needs to pile on a schedule of work and do-good tasks, I think a lot of the energy devoted to mindless exercises could be used more effectively. Something small- leaving something pretty for a stranger to find and cheer up their day- something that addresses a larger picture. We should not be afraid to attempt what we cannot reach alone, but one person trying inspires others, and even an attempt is better than sitting on the couch all day.</p>\n<p>We are here to work- that is clear- but we are also here to live, to learn and to work for OURSELVES. I work on my schoolwork as much as I feel is necessary (sometimes hours, sometimes minutes if that is what I feel needs to be put in) but I always make sure to do something I enjoy- something that challenges me and also just take a break. I feel that using the excuse that you are &#8220;too busy&#8221; to take on something that you are interested in is more of a weakness than a proud assertion.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we all seek the future economic stability- that dotting the &#8220;i&#8221; and crossing the &#8220;t&#8221; will at least yield a paycheck. But why should we limit ourselves now?</p></div>",

For example the Grad Graphic Design (GGD) department has an excellent HP Z3100PS that produces amazing print quality. The Interior Architecture (INTAR) Plotter is a HP 800PS which produces great line drawings at reasonable speeds and is CMYK. I bring up these two plotters because they were bought for specific reasons. The HP Z3100PS was purchased by GGD because they need a plotter that produces prints at fast speeds, high quality and be color accurate. The down side to the HP Z3100PS is the plotter uses a 12 ink system which increases the cost per inch. The HP 800PS was purchased by INTAR to produce CAD drawings and is a four ink system and is not designed to produce photo realistic prints. All plotters are not equal and they have attributes that fill certain needs of the departments they are in.</p>\n<p>If you have more questions or would like to discuss plotting further please contact me any time.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br/>\nJustin Bazar<br/>\nComputer Support Specialist<br/>\nRhode Island School of Design<br/>\nOffice of Information Technology<br/>\n169 Weybosset Street<br/>\nSuite 307<br/>\nProvidence, RI<br/>\n02903<br/>\nUSA</p>\n<p>phone: +1 401 277 4992<br/>\nemail: <a href=\"mailto:jbazar@risd.edu\">jbazar@risd.edu</a>\n</p><p/></div>",

For a number of years, RISD had a pay for print system that was only Mac-based and not very flexible, but we quickly found this was not acceptable and not as inclusive as necessary.  For a year or so (as we were evaluating new systems), we offered &#8220;free&#8221; printing and found as someone said, an excessive amount of printing (in the six figure range). </p>\n<p>OIT in close collaboration with departmental technical support began a comprehensive system evaluation of over a dozen systems. A system was selected and implemented about three years ago. As part of this process, we worked closely with Toshiba, to determine a more realistic cost per print &#8211; both for b&amp;w and color (laser &amp; Plotter) printers.  This evaluation took into consideration true cost per print based manufacturer specifications &#8211;and saturation of color at varied levels from 10% to 80%. &#8211; which led to our current pricing models.  The second year of operation, we upgraded the paper stock (for color laser) in collaboration with advice from several Graphic Design students&#8211; which resulted in upgrading the paper stock for better quality.</p>\n<p>It is my understanding that the large format printers in several departments were selected &amp; implemented and priced, based on departmental requirements, so I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m the best person to assess quality; perhaps local technical support would be better versed in this regard.  Thanks Justin for your clarification.</p>\n<p>The system has seen several upgrades &#8211; just recently, a new software system was installed which provides greater flexibility &#8211; in particular for pricing large format printing options (per inch).  </p>\n<p>Prints-On-Que is designed to offer a discounted per print charge &#8211; based on market rates that cover the consumable costs (paper &amp; toner) and help pay for the maintenance, repair and cyclical replacement of printers as necessary.<br/>\nOverall, the system has succeeded in its goal of helping to reduce excessive printing, offering a middle of the road printing solution for the college, providing a sustainable print solution for the college. </p>\n<p>We are always looking to improve the system from both a quality and price point and we welcome your input in this process.

In addition to the research done with Toshiba, we&#8217;ve also worked with HP&#8217;s costing tools to confirm the operating costs and thus cost per inch charges.</p>\n<p>Our current plotters are two steps up from entry level and several steps away from the type of devices I&#8217;d like for our students. Unfortunately, plotters are also considerably expensive and compete for capital budget funds with many other important items/programs. Cost is the overweight child opposite those other considerations on the see-saw.</p>\n<p>Cost aside, the more complex the plotter becomes the more difficult it is for the untrained to use. I&#8217;m sure William can attest to the number of reprints we have to offer even for our current devices because jobs are incorrectly prepared&#8230; Load sheet to continue sound familiar? <img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"/> If we&#8217;re going to open a dialogue about plotting then we should also discuss ways to improve user education to maximize whatever investment we make. In the BEB incoming students receive a forty-five minute plotting tutorial (something Lynette began last year) which scratches the surface but isn&#8217;t enough to help someone become proficient.</p>\n<p>WRT quality I think we have some room to improve here. We could significantly improve the quality of our current devices by upgrading our roll stock from 20lb uncoated bright white bond to a 24lb coated white bond. The coating minimizes ink bleed into the paper resulting in sharper, brighter prints. I&#8217;ve looked at this a few times and estimate it would cost an additional $1400/yr to make that switch. That $1400 would be a wise investment and something I&#8217;m certainly willing to do if we can confirm that won&#8217;t upset the bottom line too much. Even with better systems this paper quality will remain an issue.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also currently looking at ways to lock a plotting queue to B+W only, even if the device is color. We could potentially offer a reduced cost B+W line plotting option without upsetting our current queues. If it&#8217;s possible with the technology we&#8217;re currently using then I hope to have something in a trial over winter session.</p>\n<p>Just my initial thoughts&#8230;\n</p><p/></div>",

I am a transfer student and at my previous school, University of Delaware, which does not have a heavily funded program we had access to high quality printers at a price, but at least the quality of print we were expected to make could be achieve on campus. Having to outsource at a school of the caliber of RISD shouldn&#8217;t need to outsource.

I can see the point of a definite increase in waste if printing was all of the sudden free but I strongly disagree with what we are being charged for when we print. I can see covering cost of materials. That would include paper and ink at cost. If the school is marking any of these things up that is horribly unfair to us for reasons listed by everyone else. (its a necessity for GD, we are required to print so much by teachers&#8230;.) I do not feel that it is even remotely fair to charge us for the maintenance or cost of replacing these machines. We don&#8217;t get any say in what machines we are being forced to buy and these things should be paid for by the school if they want to be considered an art and design school. Art and Design schools, especially ones that boast such a great reputation, should have art and design tools available to those who are paying to go there. We also need a relatively small amount of tools in GD, none of which are provided for us. We basically need our computers(we pay for them) maybe drawing or mockup supplies, (we buy them, overpriced at the RISD store), and printers (the problem at hand). If the school can afford to stock the library and other buildings with obnoxiously overpriced designer furniture(google some of the chairs and lamps in the library, they are expensive) just to look good to the visitors, then they can afford to buy us a printer when it needs to be done. If not then there is some horrible budget management going on. Undergrad needs a plotter. Look at the curriculum, see how many posters we are assigned and figure that none of them can be printed on printers provided by the school. It&#8217;s just upsetting that the school would rather invest its money on its image with new buildings and fancy furniture that giving the students the proper tools to learn their discipline. We deserve it, we are definitely paying for it. I&#8217;d rather my money go to nice printers and studios than a fancy lamp in the library. Im here to work and learn, I&#8217;d rather have the tools that enable me to do that properly than nice looking things all over the school that don&#8217;t aid me in doing either. </p>\n<p>Also, I put the last two dollars I had on my print card two weeks ago and set up and printed a project. It printed wrong. I told the monitor on duty what happened and showed him that I set it all up right. He agreed that I set everything up fine but said the only way that he could refund me or let me print again for free is if the job didn&#8217;t print at all. So I went to class without any money left or homework while wasting paper and ink.\n</p><p/></div>",

Too often the laser printers in the grad studio will malfunction (e.g. start spitting out random numbers instead of the files sent to them) creating unnecessary waste and many frustrations. Furthermore, the undergrads clearly need a plotter. While most of us in both departments do have our own printers (I happen to have three: two ink-jets and one color laser), few of us can afford to have printers that have greater than 13&#215;19 in. capacity, which is often needed.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I&#8217;ve seen with our payment system is that it is often not functional. Student print cards stop working for no reason, have their money eaten by the card swipers, or students are unable to put more money on their cards. At 3 or 4 in the morning, there is nobody around to fix your card. The unfortunate reality is that the hours offered by OIT and other RISD services are simply not the hours when students are printing, and are consequently somewhat useless.</p>\n<p>I fully support free printing for the many reasons already listed above by others. However, if that can&#8217;t happen, I ask that we at least move to a better electronic printing-payment system. Something where you&#8217;d be able to print to the system directly from your computer through your webmail/webadvisor account and any cost would be billed to you automatically at the end of each semester. Other schools have implemented such systems seamlessly (see &#8220;GreenPrint&#8221; Dartmouth&#8217;s printing system here: <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/equipment/greenprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/equipment/greenprint/</a> where, like Brown, there is also a certain amount of &#8220;free printing money&#8221; allocated to each student at the beginning of each semester), although again, I would urge the elimination of any kind of middle-man station, as that is where I&#8217;ve seen the most problems.\n</p><p/></div>",

Not just plotting, but as Dave and I have spoken about a few times, in-person tutorials on laptop care, and perhaps an assortment of other topics.</p>\n<p>Justin, to answer your questions: I apologize as I believe my comments were mis-leading. Plotting down to the dollars is probably comparable when reviewing RISD and off-campus locations. However, as an architecture student who has large volumes of plots on a regular basis, when I go off-campus to Concept Link or American Blueprint I have generally found that I will be charged less for line drawings. Whereas, at RISD there is no delineation regardless of how much or how little ink one uses.</p>\n<p>Justin, as you mentioned about specific plotters being applicable to the communities they primarily serve here at RISD, in Architecture, line weights are of paramount importance in plot quality. No one wants to spend a semester working their butts off and have a review in which you are chastised for unacceptable representations because the lines of your plans and sections were too light, or too dark. </p>\n<p>I have plotted at Interior Architecture, both BEB plotters, and off-campus locations. Each plotter produces a different final plot. It is both interesting, and at times, frustrating. I accept this situation out of an understanding that a particularly important plotted representation will need additional attention, time, and care, and perhaps, multiple plots ($$) in order to reach a level of refinement for a review.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the best solution for people such as myself who are this particular. I should add that I am very understanding of the point made in this thread that plotting improvements would add a significant increase in burden to the budget.</p>\n<p>In the end, I create re-presentations of ideas. My three dimensional creative energy and pursuits manifest themselves through two dimensional computer drawings. Among other and much more important things, I have certainly learned very well here at RISD that there is a considerable cost associated with sharing my creative endeavors with others. </p>\n<p>For now, it hovers somewhere around $7.20 per plot.\n</p><p/></div>",

He gives examples of how when we&#8217;d get sick, we&#8217;d know which herbs in the forest would make us feel better &#8212; now we go to the doctor; or when we&#8217;d get in a fight with friends we&#8217;d resolve it ourselves, and now we go get a lawyer. I bring up Ilych as it raises a question I have myself often &#8212; when there is a new technology that solves a problem for us, we become enslaved to its ability to deliver for us. When we are average people non-creatives, then we want the technology to work for us; yet when we are stellar creatives, we do not let the limitations around us become our own. </p>\n<p>As someone who has used computer printing technologies more than most, I am very aware that I&#8217;ve never encountered a printer/plotter that doesn&#8217;t break down when you absolutely need it to work. As someone who has watched the emergence of lasercutters and used them in my own artwork observes how architecture students here and at MIT rely upon them so much &#8230; I guess part of me as a creative wonders about the core issue of &#8220;reliance.&#8221; And when do some of these enabling possibilities make us ironically even more disabled? As I sat in Prof. Peter Tagiuri&#8217;s course last week and observed a variety of elaborate lasercut models, I couldn&#8217;t stop wondering how odd it felt that the one model that seemed to express a student&#8217;s intent amidst all of her lavish lasercut models the most clearly &#8230; was the one composed of paper and makeshift handcuts. </p>\n<p>Anyways, things to add to the pot-of-thinking on a post Thanksgiving Day day. I&#8217;m thankful to all the students here for thinking out loud in this space, and look forward to hearing from more of you. You are RISD&#8217;s future. Literally. And if you have any more brain cycles you&#8217;d like to contribute, please speak to other strengths and weaknesses here at RISD in the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/11/23/the-invisible-hand/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Hand</a> strand. </p>\n<p>Regards, John\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>John,</p>\n<p>You make good points. The limitations imposed by our printing options can inspire creativity in how to produce effective work despite them. After all, the cost of printing will be a factor as we enter the working world, why shouldn&#8217;t we start taking it into consideration now? That being said, I disagree that printing should be free and that it should be added to the tuition bill, since that will make it easier for people on both sides (administration and students) to ignore the true costs of operation, thus enabling waste. Although I don&#8217;t think maintainance of the printers should be covered by the fee we pay per page. Just as there is no added cost to maintain other facilities (say, computer lab users paying for the monitors/technicians), this should be covered by the school. Also, I&#8217;m assuming time spent maintaining printers is minimal compared to OIT&#8217;s other responsibilities, and I question whether this time is accurately  accounted for in the cost per page.</p>\n<p>Because, as Livia notes, I have not seen this breakdown of costs, it&#8217;s hard for me to suggest where the best areas to eliminate waste might be. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that we have black and white laser printers on most floors of the Design Center, yet they are rarely used and some are even disabled, such as the one on the seventh floor. In the future I&#8217;d suggest eliminating these and concentrating more resources toward the goal of lowering costs to students or providing better quality color printing. In general, I&#8217;d rather see fewer printers on campus that are cheaper or of better quality. The color laser printers are particularly useless to me because of their quality. I think most in my department agree. I&#8217;m a Graphic Design undergrad.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Zach,</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m reflecting on an experience I had shortly after I left MIT. There, we had really the best computers in the world (note that in the late 80s computers were still something of an oddity in non-defense-related industries). I worked for a small research foundation in Tokyo while putting myself through art school. The director of the Foundation was the late Dr Sasaki &#8212; co-founder of Sharp Electronics. Dr. Sasaki was an interesting fellow. His friends were all Nobel laureates and the likes &#8212; yet he would still talk to me and I often appreciated his openness to connect. I distinctly recall one day telling me that the foundation needed to purchase something called a &#8220;Connection Machine&#8221; &#8212; a state-of-the-art supercomputer I used at MIT. I was quite adamant about it, and recall feeling that I knew something that Dr. Sasaki didn&#8217;t, and wanted to make him more aware of the next steps in the future of humanity. Dr. Sasaki listened carefully to my arguments for 30 minutes, smiled, then said to me calmly in his quiet but powerful voice, &#8220;You know &#8230; Einstein figured out a whole universe of interesting things. Did he need a &#8216;Connection Machine&#8217; to do that?&#8221; My initial reaction was fret &#8230; that I was simply being shut down. And then as weeks progressed and with continued reflection, I set forth on a path that led me to looking for conceptually-driven thoughts over process-oriented thoughts. I&#8217;m not saying that life always takes these turns and conclusions, but it is a thought triggered by this overall discussion which on the surface appears financial in nature, but begs an opening of thinking along the conceptual dimension.

ID has some of their materials provided for them and there is no cost to use their shops. Photo has a lab fee for their high quality printers that is $200 per semester and their printers are high enough quality and only about $2k each. (I don&#8217;t think that they have a print limit per semester but I haven&#8217;t heard of students overrunning the photo printers.) Glass I believe has the actual glass provided for them (because its often recycled).<br/>\nI think that it is a little sad to think that our school doesn&#8217;t trust us enough to think that we wont frivolously print everything and anything.  Most likely if it is being printed it is necessary for some class.<br/>\nMaybe the best solution is to have a print allowance. Allow $50 dollars of free printing per semester and anything over that is charged for. Personally I think that GD should be on a separate system than other majors and it all shouldn&#8217;t be lumped into the same category. There is also such a HUGE difference between a good print and a mediocre to bad print. Print quality plays a major part in critique because it is part of our craftsmanship.\n</p><p/></div>",

I can think about the cost of running my furnace at home each month in the winter (a few hundred dollars) and scale up to what i imagine the cost is of keeping the furnaces going (easily &#8217;six figures&#8217;, annually) However, I don&#8217;t have access to any of those numbers, service contracts, prices of gas, etc. I can speculate all i want, but it doesn&#8217;t get me anywhere useful.</p>\n<p>Similarly, most of the arguments here are rarely backed up by any actual facts. &#8220;We offered &#8220;free&#8221; printing and found as someone said, an excessive amount of printing (in the six figure range).&#8221; Were a few hundred thousand pages printed or were a few hundred thousand dollars spent?  Six figures is not a value, $100 000 or 900 000 pages and $53 000 of toner is a value. Consequentially, wild speculation takes hold: &#8220;it would create a large waste and <em>does not seem</em> practical,&#8221; &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t think</em> that free printing is desirable or realistic,&#8221; &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t think</em> we should be encouraged to print everything we make at RISD.&#8221; These are valid concerns, backed up by fear or gut feelings or something else altogether, but none of those are legitimate ways to prove anything. Instead, we fall into the polarizing language of rhetoric which impedes thoughtful analysis.</p>\n<p>To the claims that &#8220;free printing is not feasible nor desired,&#8221; at MIT, printing is provided free to its approximately 10,000 students and employees. I am told that at one time there was a pay to print option, but the cost of it, its maintenance, and the related support staff to resolve $.20 misprint charges were considered unreasonable. As a result, the printing budget was absorbed by the school&#8217;s IS&amp;T department that was fed up with fielding numerous complaints. In the various fiefdoms of MIT, each department usually absorbs these costs, but usually this is minimal because most students typically use the free IS&amp;T sponsored printers (notable exceptions are the media lab and csail). Carnegie Mellon University addresses this same problem by silently putting a thirty dollar print quota on each user&#8217;s account. <em>If free printing were not desired, neither school would offer these services to their customers. </em></p>\n<p>Perhaps you counter that this is an unfair comparison: MIT&#8217;s IS&amp;T is <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/ist/org/comm/newsletter/09162008/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fantastically well funded</a> with an annual $75 million operating budget and a $15 million capital budget. They can perhaps easily offset a &#8220;six figure&#8221; cost. Because i cannot find anything about oit&#8217;s operating expenses (much less the cost of its continuing pharos investment), i can&#8217;t really say whether or not there is even a comparable comparison. And fantastically, neither can anyone else here (except for perhaps the comptroller!).</p>\n<p>The reason this argument persists is because of the lack of information and the massive amount of speculation. Zach Greene notes that this problem prevents us from moving forward in any meaningful way. This impasse is convenient for the administration, but effectively snubs the resolution of student grievances.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Marcos and students, </p>\n<p>There is a long list of things to address at RISD. The issues range in all sizes. XS, S, M, L, XL, XLLL. And so forth. Having seen how students print documents here at RISD I admit I was surprised at the inconvenience. That said, MIT is a different place than RISD. MIT&#8217;s endowment and research funding is at a level that affords all kinds of things that a school like RISD simply cannot emulate. CMU and Yale as well benefit in similar ways to MIT. In addition, graphic design students have different printing requirements beyond the simple 8.5&#8243; by 11&#8243; sheet. I get that. And then the question is if students were to choose to go to a different school than RISD because the printing services are not at par, then that would be the choice a student is free to make. That said, I know that students here are well aware that RISD does many things better than at other schools &#8212; otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t come to RISD. If you want to be at a school that does technology like no other school in the world, then you&#8217;d go to MIT.</p>\n<p>Now, are there things that RISD can do a better job at? You bet. And is there a long list of issues to address? You bet. And for each issue is there a need to find legitimate data to back up assumptions. You bet. But the question is not isolated to one of the issue of printing. And for all data to backup assumptions there is committee work and study-costs needed to invest into that process of clear accountability. There is no single simple picture of the complex issues at hand for our school. And I&#8217;m committed to eventually drawing that picture to achieve greater clarity. </p>\n<p>Towards the end of last year I connected with the Student Alliance and Graduate Student Alliance in a meeting to talk with students to get a sense for what their concerns for their future look like. On the top of their minds was how they will be prepared for employment in this new era. I continue to wonder, what else? (and what else besides printing?) When the term gets going I&#8217;ll want to connect with the SA/GSA meeting forum again &#8212; so I urge you as a grad student to connect with the GSA head Jessica Roundy. I&#8217;ll be seeing her and other student government reps shortly so now is a good time.</p>\n<p>So in short, we will need to think strategically for RISD&#8217;s future. Ask the big questions &#8212; that will help us figure out what littler questions get asked &#8230; or else instead remain unanswered &#8212; because *everything* cannot be done. But what is important, should be done. I look to all at RISD to help get involved in the discussion of what is absolutely core, vital, and key to RISD&#8217;s ability to sustain a leadership role in the field of art and design. </p>\n<p>This is my work right now &#8212; getting to a sense with the faculty, students, and staff as to where we need to prioritize (and deprioritize) our efforts together as one team on a mission to support President Obama in helping our nation and the world go where it needs to go. If enough of the community can communicate and mobilize, by May 2009 we can form a clear picture of our future together &#8212; and built around that future we can target efforts that leave no ambiguity and give clarity to what we will achieve. Last fall I met with the Faculty Steering Committee and with Deans and Department Heads to begin this discussion, and in February will be connecting with the Divisions one by one. </p>\n<p>Students should reach out to student government and get involved, and to involve your colleagues in discussions about what art and design need to be thinking/making/doing. In this core discussion of &#8220;Printing should be free,&#8221; I want to hear what else fits in the category of &#8220;______ should be ______&#8221; from a student&#8217;s perspective. Where do the majority and minority opinions sit, and what are the financial, structural, and competitive implications of realizing a &#8220;____ should be ____&#8221;? Talk with your SA and GSA reps so that they can collect your voices as one. Talk with your Faculty, Department Heads, and Deans to understand the context from the perspective of the instructors. Share the information here, or anywhere else that other students can benefit from whatever can be discovered. There is no limitation to what can be achieved when each individual of our community chooses to do, rather than simply ask. Let&#8217;s do this together.</p>\n<p>Thanks, JM\n</p><p/></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>The philosopher and economist <strong>Adam Smith</strong> (1723-1790) posited an &#8220;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand\">invisible hand</a>&#8221; that would move supply and demand according to forces governed by a market of competitors. Smith&#8217;s simple point was that if you&#8217;re making a choice between having a hamburger at McDonald&#8217;s or at Burger King, if the meal at McD&#8217;s was superior to the one at BK (where superior can be defined along many axes &#8212; price, taste, cleanliness of restaurant, etc.) then customers will flock to McD&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>It comes down to the point of acknowledging competitive forces, and the realization that we compete in an open market of many choices of schools. In the same way that students can point out one of possibly many competitive <em>weaknesses</em> as in the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/11/21/freedom-of-print/\">printing discussion</a>, RISD has many competitive <em>strengths</em> for students and its the reason why we all flock to RISD. By understanding the balance of both of our competitive <em>strengths</em> and <em>weaknesses,</em> and to look at them in one big picture, we can then consider the arduous task of lessening a particular strength in order to correct a particular weakness since financial resources are finite and we need to always balance the budget.</p>\n<p>In May of this year I issued a general <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/24/many-eyes-i-heart-risd/\">survey</a> of the graduating seniors (U and G) which was useful to get a sense of the spirit of RISD at the time, but not entirely constructive as it included anonymous contributions from people outside of the RISD community as well so I couldn&#8217;t get a clear read. Our community has come a long way from having no central communication point beyond e-mail and the Daily Jolt, to many forums for conversations with leadership both online and <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/09/21/start-conversation-here/\">off-line</a>. I feel we are at a sufficiently mature state as a community to talk about weaknesses <em>and</em> strengths in regards to our competition out there. I can tell you that right now as your President, I need to hear about both of them &#8212; and continuously so.</p>\n<p>As for competitive <em>strengths,</em> I have heard of and seen the strength of our passionate community, diversity of majors, our devoted faculty, our relentlessly imaginative students, our many committed supporting staff, and so forth. As for competitive <em>weaknesses,</em> I have heard of and seen our lack of cultural and socioeconomic diversity, our lack of shared facilities that cross disciplines, our printing issues (as below), and so forth. What would be instrumental as we continue to think about RISD as a community of higher education in art and design, is a contribution of thought in this strand &#8212; making your own invisible hand visible &#8212; with a running list of our perceived strengths (in comparison to schools X and Y listed explicitly) and weaknesses (in comparison to schools A and B listed explicitly) from the perspective of one&#8217;s major in C.</p>\n<p>Note that academia functions upon an ongoing self-review process called using &#8220;visiting committees&#8221; where external reviewers come to campus to provide a competitive assessment of a program. Such reviews happen anywhere from every 2-years to 10-years depending upon the school, but as we know today the world is changing in realtime. And students live in that realtime world as they are most influenced by the invisible hands that surround how they make choices. In any case, the printing strand made me think that we have the opportunity to think broadly about RISD and its position in our world.</p>\n<p>All data that you contribute here is extremely pivotal, and by existing in this Two forum it has a chance to help shape RISD&#8217;s future as a combined written record. The reason why I sit in random cafeterias around campus and sit with students is to try to get a sense of things I cannot hear from the reports and data that surrounds me as your President. The reason why I might be checking this blog at least two times per day is so that I can hear things that I might not hear on the street. I cannot know, if I cannot hear. And I cannot make decisions on your behalf, without knowing what you think.</p>\n<p>I believe in open and transparent communications that engage not just a few parties, but many &#8230; and ideally <em>all</em> constituents and <em>in the wide open</em>. Only by doing so can we truly leverage the tremendous potential power of all the folks here at RISD. And by doing so, we have the once-in-<em>our</em>-lifetimes opportunity to make a BIG difference in this world. Good luck to us all. -JM</p>\n<p><em>PS Note that if this is your first time coming to Two and posting please read the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/community-guidelines/\">community guidelines</a>, the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/anonymous-posting-guidelines/\">anonymous posting guidelines</a>, an excellent past strand on the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/06/27/the-value-of-crits/\">nature of critique</a>, and also the ongoing &#8220;<a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/best-of-two/\">Best of Two</a>&#8221; resource to review what territory we&#8217;ve covered thus far as a community.</em></p></div>",

In the architecture department there seems to be a lack of knowledge/concern about this among teachers and students alike. This can&#8217;t really be solved by slapping on some course about solar panels. I think it&#8217;s a problem that is more fundamental, in that we are taught, in a way, that the genius of design is primordial and is born before all petty considerations, like energy conservation.  This is also the strength, in that design originating from some pure and honest source is a truly beautiful thing. isn&#8217;t there some way that responsible design can come from there too?

While having speedy and functional wireless internet across campus, for example, may not be something a prospective student would inquire about on a tour, it is certainly something that matters and contributes to the success of individuals who are already here. Yet seeing designer furniture in the library (as one commenter in the printing discussion pointed out), for example, is likely to contribute to a visitor&#8217;s impression of the school.

        "content": "<div><p>I would like to discuss the need for a more with-the-times curriculum for the graphic design department or add it to the wish-list or something! It is quite apparent that the world is becoming more and more digital. As a senior who has already begun interviewing for jobs after graduation, I notice one thing that I have been told over and over again in interviews is that web and digital skills are a given (and that is coming from a variety of design firms and in-house design departments). If you look on artworks, more and more of the postings for jobs and internships are asking for web designers or people who have skills in flash, dreamweaver, etc. I have met with Karen Harris in the career services office who also has told me it would be wise for me to take a digital class so that I can have that skill on my resume; it will open up many more doors. While our school prides itself on preparing its students for the world beyond RISD, it appears that my department may not be holding up its end of the bargain. Yes, the graphic design department offers a web design elective, but there is absolutely no guarantee that you will be able to get in by the time you graduate! With one section being offered a semester, that provides around 36 spots a year, minus the fact that the wintersession course slots can be taken by non-majors.  So, that clearly does not give us all a chance to take the class by graduation. Not to mention, quite often this class conflicts with required studio sections, Type, Degree Project, Color, etc. Still, additional sections of the class have not been added. Though, I do not think that is the solution to the problem. I believe that digital classes should be required and worked into the core graphic design curriculum. I have brought this to this issue to the attention of my superiors in my department and one response that I got that completely infuriated me was that RISD has a strong record of preparing its students for the world beyond RISD and that record it is not based on &#8220;technical skills.&#8221;  Appalling! For someone to seemingly pass off digital skills in my generation as unimportant, unnecessary &#8220;technical skills&#8221; unworthy of our curriculum is outrageous! Yes, RISD does a great job of emphasizing process and problem solving but as a graphic designer I need to know certain &#8220;technical skills.&#8221; Having knowledge of software and programs is just a crucial as learning how to set type and layout a page. Honestly, when we graduate and are applying for jobs who is going to get hired, the RISD designer with brilliant ideas but not the expertise to bring those ideas to fruition (so a second person would need to be hired) or a designer from another school with good ideas and who is proficient in a variety of software and media? I really think it would benefit us students, the department, and the school to update the curriculum and make digital design a more prominent feature. I also would like to point out that our teachers should be keeping current with not only design trends, but also with software. I have had a class both my sophomore and my junior year where the teacher has assigned a flash project, however had absolutely no idea how to use the program. They then proceeded with the assignment and high expectations of the final product, while they had a student clumsily try to explain the program. While I applaud certain teacher&#8217;s efforts to incorporate digital projects into their classes,  I think the teachers should all take a seminar to familiarize themselves with these programs rather than rely on a student to do the teaching (a frustrating and ineffective route).</p>\n<p>President Maeda , I feel that this issue is right up your ally and I am eager to hear how you, and others, feel about this issue.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for listening.\n</p><p/></div>",

When I was looking around at colleges, some of them have lockers for freshmen.  The ability to store supplies or even assignments in lockers at RISD would make situations in the dorms easier.  I suppose a specific weakness would be RISD&#8217;s geography and the size of its dorm rooms in relation to the large quantity of items needed for its education.  This, of course, is not an urgent problem, but a locker is something that a lot of people would appreciate.<br/>\nWith that said, I like wintersession.</p>\n<p>Ross\n</p><p/></div>",

I love this program and am so thankful that I have gotten the chance to participate in it. This program has been running here since 1960, but this is the first year that they have cut our time here from a full year to only a single semester. While I realize that this was due to making it more cost-effective and allowing more students to come who might otherwise have not been able to take out an entire school year, I still believe that the year-long EHP program should continue to be available to those who wish to develop their work here further. </p>\n<p>RISD is my home, and I love it so.<br/>\nThat said, I believe that our biggest downfall is the fact that so many talented individuals who get into this school find that they cannot actually come because of the lack of much-needed financial-aid offered them. Then, those (other than the very financially-fortunate) who decide to come anyways struggle to stay afloat  and end up wiping out their and their family&#8217;s entire savings accounts and racking up $100,000+/- worth of debt just to get through a full 4 years.<br/>\nIt doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that RISD would do so little to help make sure we keep the best, most hard-working students here, just because they may not have had one of the top ranked portfolios when they first applied.\n</p><p/></div>",

President Mandle had engaged some speculatory discussions regarding the site&#8217;s use with the developer as this new site aspires to become the <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/\">Tate Modern</a> of the New England area (architectural drawings look eerily like the new Tate actually) so there was a feeling that RISD should somehow be involved. As one of the transition items on my list, I ventured into this unknown territory on a listen-and-learn mission as I am apt to doing right now and for the foreseeable future as I transition into RISD.</p>\n<p>As I expressed in my <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/04/08/april-18-faculty-presentation/&quot;\">address</a> to the Faculty last Friday, which I deeply enjoyed due to the intellectual camaraderie I felt there, in many senses President Mandle&#8217;s 15 years really cemented the notion of &#8220;the RISD Campus.&#8221; Whereas in my upcoming years at RISD, I see my role as trying to develop together with you the idea of &#8220;the RISD Community.&#8221; Thus although this site I was presented with looked extremely beautiful and interesting, as far as I can tell <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu\">our RISD</a> is not in the mood for any new territorial advances <i>a la</i> the impressive spreading of the Brown campus. I myself believe that if RISD is to grow any where, it should grow in scholarship funds, opportunities for enhancing academic excellence, leadership on the Web, and all in all representing the quintessential intellectual community that gracefully individualizes, mixes, re-mixes, refines, endears, hybridizes, and advances <i>fine art, design,</i> and <i>the liberal arts</i> in the 21st century. And I&#8217;m always looking for feedback and discourse on where we all think RISD should go.</p></div>",

The two numbers are added together and you are given a number 2-10. They start at the bottom, giving people scholarships until they run out. This usually happens around 3.5 from what I was told by the financial aid office.</p>\n<p>But the problem is the number your get when you come in is never re-evaluated, and stays with you your entire time. So although a student may have more need later on, or if that student ends up being a better student than originally expected, he or she will not see a change in scholarship funding through the years. (if this is not the case, let me know, it is just how it was explained to me by the finical aid office)</p>\n<p>I understand why it is too. I know in order to do that some people would also lose funding from year to year, and I don&#8217;t that that should happen.

This includes keeping the donors of those scholarships informed and engaged. If those donors are pleased with our efforts and feel good about their relationship with us, they may add to their existing scholarship and can inspire others to make a commitment to RISD. A wonderful way to inspire is through the students. Just this week I received emails from two students who are doing amazing things. One student was looking for funding to be able to pursue an internship at a nationally recognized non-profit whose mission she is extremely dedicated to. The other student has been accepted for a position as an assistant and resident at one of the best residency programs in Europe for his craft. These students, among others, are incredibly passionate about their art and it&#8217;s heartbreaking to tell them that there is not a scholarship that matches their criteria. These stories are important though for me to know and pass along in order to show donors the types of programs they can support, and where the need exists.  On another note, besides scholarship support, it would be great to compile all funding opportunities available for students. I have been directing students to the campus resources I know of but if there are others, send them my way and I&#8217;ll be sure to pass them along to the students who contact me!

Now I don&#8217;t have such a simple means to donate towards so I thought I&#8217;d start a &#8220;free&#8221; book section on the 4th floor when such a thing happens. Note that the 4th floor of ProvWash has some gorgeous artwork that has been hand-curated by Provost Jessie Shefrin so there&#8217;s stuff to look at as well. When this happens in the future I&#8217;ll ping on this thread.</p>\n<p><i>PS Earlier this year I donated the bulk of the books I once owned to the RISD Library and to interested Deans/Faculty; I also think that the lion&#8217;s share of the books were acquired by Prof. Teri Rueb for the Digital+Media bookshelves in the CIT.</i></p></div>",

Was darkly amused to discover that Google Earth has the label for Market Square on the park adjacent to the canal with the war monuments in it.  The tag for RISD as a school is located on the bridge over the canal. The Wikipedia tag for RISD is on the college building (not so bad matches the school address). The wiki tag for Carr Hause is on the  one of our parking lots.   Wasn&#8217;t sure how to contact Google to correct the errors. Would be neat to tell google what our building names are to add correct tags, and even suggest a location like the admissions office for the main RISD label. Would help those planning trips to RISD locate admissions to get a tour, or visit one our departments. Anyone know how to correct Google Earth / Maps?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>The website I made, mentioned above, was something I&#8217;ve been working on over most of the last four weeks of Wintersession. I was fortunate enough to sit in on a Web Design class, and followed along with the class on coding exercises. The final project was to create a new website- buy a domain name from a hosting company, work out designs, build wireframe templates, and then fill in content. </p>\n<p>The start of the process was to draw out a sitemap: a simple brainstorm map of how pages in the site would link to each other. I thought about goals for the website- asking questions like who is the intended audience? What browser works best for the site? </p>\n<p>Drawing wireframes and templates in Illustrator (as well as rough sketches in notebooks) was the most important step- I used these visuals to help outline where divs and different HTML tags would be used on a page. When actually building the webpages, I had the wireframe sketches open on my computer next to the coding software (DreamWeaver). I used CSS rules to try and make the webpages look as close as possible to the sketches. </p>\n<p> A lot of the process was tweaking and editing. When everything was basically ok, I put in text and photos, and finally uploaded the data onto the internet.  I had friends look at the website on different computers and browsers to see where there might still be some problems- so more editing (Internet Explorer = frustration!). I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll still be changing small details in the upcoming days.</p>\n<p>As I was working on all this, I attended the Digital Foundations lectures and workshops. The lectures gave me a context on what I was working on: how computers function, the kind of languages computers operate in,  and the way people work with this technology. The workshops gave an introduction to CSS and Processing. This was helpful because knowledgeable students were on hand to give advice, which in turn informed my website design. </p>\n<p>Ultimately I&#8217;ve been learning between classes, lectures and help from fellow students. I&#8217;ve also looked up numerous websites online for inspiration and learned from their source code. (A helpful tool in Firefox is the plugin Firebug that highlights different parts of the source code and lets you temporarily edit code). A great website for inspiration is <a href=\"http://www.webcreme.com/.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webcreme.com/.</a> Webcreme gives links to well-designed websites.</p>\n<p>My site is hosted by Bluehost, about $7 a month, and they have very good support. Another great hosting company is 1and1.com.<br/>\nMy process work is online at <a href=\"http://process.karinkunori.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://process.karinkunori.com/</a>  under the heading of  &#8220;Final Project.&#8221;<br/>\nThanks for reading through this terribly long post- hope it helped.</p>\n<p>-Karin K\n</p><p/></div>",

    "content": "<div><p><strong>Sarah Greenfield</strong> wants us to begin a conversation about registering for classes. <em>Thanks, Sarah.</em></p>\n<p>_______________</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see some discussion on the trials and tribulations of registering for classes at RISD! I know there&#8217;s already been some talk about class order for registration, but there are a few other issues that I think need addressing and I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;ve all been brought up here.</p>\n<p>The first issue is the number and size of classes in relation to the number of students. It seems the freshman class gets bigger every year, but I haven&#8217;t seen a similar increase in the number of classes offered, or in class size. I&#8217;m a senior, and I found myself shut out of classes I really wanted to take during registration for my final semester in the spring. I can&#8217;t help but feel like this shouldn&#8217;t still be happening. I&#8217;m all for small classes, but there are classes with so few spaces that even seniors can&#8217;t make it in. Maybe we need more sections of popular classes?</p>\n<p>The second issue (and this seems the most problematic to me) is our registration system itself&#8212;WebAdvisor. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve met a single student who doesn&#8217;t absolutely hate this program. WebAdvisor is totally unable to handle a large number of people using it at the same time (which is just what it needs to be able to do) and the server crashes every single time registration begins. Signing up for classes is a nightmare when you might have to spend 45 minutes (like I did today) trying to load pages and logging in and out to get the program to respond so you can try to get into that class with only two spaces left (see issue number one!). I&#8217;m really not sure what the alternative is (another program?) but I feel that we should look at the systems of other schools to try to find something more functional.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I too find that registering for classes is one of the greatest frustrations I have with this school and I am so glad this discussion is being had. First, it is true, the number of classes offered does not seem to correlate at all to the number of students and that is outrageous! I am in the graphic design department, one of the larger departments, and I have noticed that only 10 electives are being offered in the spring. Now that number seems decent, but when you look at the number of students we have versus the number of students that can be offered spaces in these classes (about 120) that leaves way too many students without a class to take! We students are required to take a certain number of classes besides our core curriculum, and I think the majority of us want to. So the school needs to do a better job of facilitating that. It seems that getting into elective classes might be left up to the so called &#8220;lottery system&#8221; and the notion that if you do not get into a class one semester you will have another chance the next semester. I do not think that is fair for 2 reasons. One, I think everyone who wants to take an additional class every semester should be able to! Second, in my 9 or 10 semesters of being assigned a webadvisor time slot I have never once landed one of the early time slots, and I am sure I am not alone in this. So semester after semester we watch as our first, second, and third choice classes fill up before our time rolls around.<br/>\nWhile on this topic of availability I would also like to bring up Wintersession and that there do not seem to be enough classes for the entire student body! I, as well as a handful of other students, are not currently registered for any wintersession classes and yet all liberal arts and studio courses say they have zero availability and teachers who I have emailed all say they have long waiting lists. How on earth is it possible that there are not enough spaces for all students? I heard that there was a glitch with the system that allowed some students to register for 2 classes before some were able to register for one and that that was supposed to be resolved (I do not think that spaces were going to open up was ever really publicized). So, some of us are still without a class and cannot get into a class.<br/>\nSecond, I would like to discuss class choices in relation to availability. Semester after semester I notice that certain liberal arts classes and studios fill up immediately and if you do not have one of those lucky time slots than you can forget it. If I, and other students notice how some classes are way more popular than others, than I am sure department heads must notice this too. So, I think that adding more sections of these classes would be a great thing.<br/>\nI do not mean to rant, but I just have these concerns and emailing teachers and department heads has yet to provide me with any answers or solutions.<br/>\nThanks\n</p><p/></div>",

If there is a long waitlist for the same class EVERY SEMESTER (WEB DESIGN!), then RISD needs to hire some more instructors and add as many sections as necessary to meet the demand. I was lucky enough to get the first registration time for spring (does anyone know how this actually gets assigned??) I got two of the most in-demand classes. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s fair.</p>\n<p>I know several other grads who are shopping around for classes that remain open. The ones that still have spots have gotten bad reviews from other grads in the past. I think most students know which classes are less than ideal, but the faculty fail to address the bad reviews. I&#8217;m guessing this system is a big part of why so many students end up doing independent studies (which is not bad, but is not necessarily the student&#8217;s top choice.)</p>\n<p>This should be like any other supply and demand relationship. Please stop offering classes that no one signs up for and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add more sections of the ones that are in demand. </p>\n<p>All graphic designers are graduating into a digital era.

        "content": "<div><p>While I think that WebAdvisor is a horrible way to approach the registration of classes, the truth is, even if WebAdvisor worked perfectly, we wouldn&#8217;t be freed from the brutality of the registration process as a whole. The source of the problem, as the other students have pointed out in this thread, is that we genuinely do not have the classes that we need to fulfill what all of the students should be able to take. Because of this, we need to rely on some lottery system that ultimately leaves a vast majority of the students in the dust, which I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all had the privilege of experiencing. Having to rely on emailing teachers and department heads individually in order to get into the classes we want should be a completely unacceptable system, yet it still seems to be the most efficient way to &#8220;register&#8221; for a class we want to take. As a sophomore, I know that I have been unable to register for the majority of the classes that I&#8217;ve been interested in, and I have had to email every single teacher of every single class in order to have any chance of being able to take it. I feel like I pay more than enough money to attend a school at which I can at least be free to take the classes I want to take, and not be left having to force classes that I don&#8217;t care about just to fulfill the requirements to graduate. As many of us have noticed, this problem is clearly due to the mismanagement of class supply/demand, and as we are accepting more and more students to RISD, the amount of classes we offer has not been able to keep up. And, of course, this is not an easy problem to fix - I know that making WebAdvisor more reliable will be the easiest and most straightforward &#8220;solution,&#8221; but I hope that everyone can realize that even a reliable WebAdvisor will do nothing to get us into the classes that aren&#8217;t able to support our right to learn. That&#8217;s too bad - I think we may have to wait quite a long time before there are enough classes for everyone.\n</p><p/></div>",

Never mind that I feel I should not have to &#8220;beg&#8221; in order to take the class I want (especially when I&#8217;m a senior and have very little time left at this school), but I&#8217;m finding that my pleas are going largely unheard, or at least not being responded to. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m incredibly anxious now because I need a 3rd studio for my spring semester, and I still don&#8217;t have one, after emailing three teachers and receiving no replies. I understand that teachers are busy with finals and perhaps some don&#8217;t check their email very often, but when that is really the only way to get in contact with them (as phone numbers aren&#8217;t usually posted), it makes things extremely difficult. I need to know, as quickly as possible, whether or not I have a chance to get into these classes, because if the waiting lists are too long, I need to explore other options.</p>\n<p>I can understand not getting 100% of my first choice classes (even in my senior year)&#8230;but not even getting the number of classes I need to graduate?

As most of the posts make clear, there are two sets of concerns being raised here.  </p>\n<p>The first has to do with the WebAdvisor system and interface, which is really about how this system is actually configured and how it performs during registration.  These are technical questions, and they are appropriately addressed by the Administrative Computing Services Group in OIT, working with the Registrar&#8217;s Office, and our system consultants at Datatel.  Nancy has already mentioned that this work is ongoing and we are hopeful that they will be resolved in the near future.</p>\n<p>As Eric and others have pointed out, the issue of how you register for classes is very different from the question of what classes in general are available to students, and when and how they gain access to these courses.  As you can imagine, figuring out how to ensure that all students in all our programs have access to the classes they need to graduate is pretty complicated, especially when the number of students in any given major can change year to year depending on the major choices of first year students; something that RISD&#8212;unlike many other schools&#8212;has maintained as an option for students and as a core value of the overall educational experience.</p>\n<p>This work of planning the curriculum happens through an annual process that begins each fall and involves each of the departments working with the Deans and Academic Affairs to ensure that there are the right number of courses of the right kind so that students will have access to the courses they need in order to make normal progress through their major programs and their other graduation requirements.  This is our first and most important concern.  </p>\n<p>Beyond this, there is a good deal of flexible, elective or non-scripted space within the curriculum&#8212;everything from departmental electives, to classes for non-majors, to Wintersession courses, independent or internship options, open topical courses and studios, etc.  This region of relatively open and flexible space represents an area in the curriculum where, ideally, many of the things that students want to learn align with many of the things that faculty want to teach, and where there is greater freedom to experiment, to be responsive to new or emerging areas of faculty or student interest, and so on.  </p>\n<p>Every curriculum has to work with these kind of balances in order to achieve what it does in fact achieve when students go to sign up for classes.  We have to balance the possibility for flexibility and experimentation with the need to provide access to the more structured elements of the curriculum.  We have to weigh the benefits of small classes against the desire on the part of students to have access to these classes and these faculty.  We have to balance the demands of students for certain kinds of classes with the interests and expertise of the faculty in terms of what they teach. </p>\n<p>While I have never known of a system where students did not get closed out of some of the classes they wanted to take, this does not mean that we cannot improve upon how the current system works.  Sharing experience&#8212;both negative and positive&#8212;is a good place to start.  A next step might be to try to move from the level of individual experiences with the registration process to see what the shared experience and share priorities for improvement might be.  As has been suggested on the Jolt, this might be a worthy topic to pursue from the student side through the vehicles of the Student Associations.  It is certainly an area that is central to the concerns of the departments and Academic Affairs.</p>\n<p>David Bogen, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi,<br/>\nPrior to earlier comments, I think there is a very easy way to track the classes on high demand.<br/>\nOnce a year, RISD can use the same system used for registration, and ask students to register for the classes that they truly want to take in both semesters. It would be a test registration, a fake one. Unlike the regular registration, courses would never appear full. So for example, if sixty people are interested in Web Design (it happened this year), it would appear in the results. Based on the statistics, our school can adjust the elective classes and offer several sections for the popular courses. I understand that some instructors believe students do not realize which classes are more necessary for their education, but my recommendation is that the elective courses should be planned in a way to satisfy student&#8217;s interest. </p>\n<p>Thank you.\n</p><p/></div>",

Nobody denies that it is impossible to make everyone happy: </p>\n<p>the concern is the <em>failure to address long-standing and well-known issues.</em></p>\n<p>I celebrate Alp&#8217;s idea to review statistics.

If not, what process is used in that meeting? Is there any independent oversight available to improve the process? </p>\n<p><strong>1. <em>RISD <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/subliminal/3225755442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">should have</a> an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=define:ombudsman\" rel=\"nofollow\">ombudsman</a></em></strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps risd already has one, but their contact information is unavailable on the web effectively making them inaccessible to almost everyone.</p>\n<p>In addition, David says,</p>\n<blockquote><p>A next step might be to try to move from the level of individual experiences with the registration process to see what the shared experience and share priorities for improvement might be&#8230; this might be a worthy topic to pursue from the student side through the vehicles of the Student Associations. It is certainly an area that is central to the concerns of the departments and Academic Affairs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While students should be consulted in any redesign, both the registrar and the office of academic affairs should be spearheading this issue. Now. Leaving this for students to address is a reflection of the interest departments have in reaching a solution to their own problems: apparently little to none. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/parents_studentservices.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">job of the registar</a> is laid out clearly: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Registrar&#8217;s Office oversees college policies and practices. Other responsibilities include publishing the course announcement catalog, and <strong>overseeing registration, class schedules, course offerings, data reports,</strong> building hours, grade rosters, grading, degree information, transfer credits, graduation requirements, certification of enrollment, readmission and transcripts.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. <em>RISD&#8217;s administration should be proactive.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The administration is well represented on the blog. You all see the ever growing laundry list of student complaints. You certainly are aware of some of these problems yourselves. Students do not get paid to address these problems, you do, by us. We are your clients: work with us to make great things we can both be proud of.</p>\n<p>It is not my responsibility as a student to propose a novel redesign of the registration process. This job belongs to the registrar and it is that office&#8217;s responsibility to begin addressing it. They will necessarily find some way to gather student input throughout the process. They do not need students to begin this process, they need to begin it themselves and they need to keep students informed, proactively. This means sending representatives, unsolicited, to student association meetings, to the met, to the library and elsewhere to gather feedback and opinions. This is a special case where the students are the clients and the administration are the designers.</p>\n<p>Finally, Nancy Severance started the discussion with:</p>\n<blockquote><p>it is difficult to mimic the load on the system of 188 students attempting to register.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I disagree. This sort of c.r.u.d. / stress testing is common in a variety of environments. That a contemporary registration system cannot deal with 200 concurrent connections is an indication of a larger problem: poor system design, bad software implementation, excessive disk swapping, not enough ram for database server, etc, and a red flag that signals its replacement. Registration via the web is not a novel problem. If updates are continuing, what are their status? Where can we find out?</p>\n<p><strong>3. <em>RISD&#8217;s administration should be accountable to the entire risd community.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It takes relatively little effort these days to broadcast and publish status information: wikis, blogs, basecamp, irc, rss, twitter, folders of pdfs, flyspray/trac/bugzilla, cvs/svn/hg commit logs, etc. These all provide ways of showing what people are working on, what people will be doing, what needs to be done and what issues remain outstanding.</p>\n<p>In design, good client/designer communication is essential. What i&#8217;m saying here is that if we think of the administration and its students like a client/designer communication issue, then the designer could be doing a much better job communicating with its clients.\n</p><p/></div>",

That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m communicating here. </p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a been a lot of work done before me by President Mandle and everyone here at RISD, and there&#8217;s a lot more to be done in the next few years ahead. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\nStudents do not get paid to address these problems, you do, by us. We are your clients: work with us to make great things we can both be proud of.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve thought for many years about this kind of transactional view of academia and understand where it comes from historically. I invite you to look at it another way. Based upon their past achievements, students earn entry to the RISD universe. They are paying members of the community here at RISD, and by the implicit pact of being part of a community, all members necessarily commit to leaving RISD a better place by the time they leave. And also help keep it going after they are gone. So part of being an active member means being able to express issues that one finds, and also to propose and enact viable solutions. Community involvement is what makes for a great community &#8212; this is what makes going to school such a unique period in a person&#8217;s life. </p>\n<p>As for the community&#8217;s need for accountability that the services provided to it are being managed properly, the fact that we have this discussion forum available to anyone at RISD affords the opportunity to create a shared, written log of the good and the bad. As far as I know, this is the first time the community has ever had such a shared vehicle. That&#8217;s progress. And progress starts in steps. Step by step. The next step is to form the shared priorities around where we will know where to put more steps into, and thus by definition, less steps as well. And that&#8217;s all happening live, and disseminated within this forum. </p>\n<p>So in summary, I don&#8217;t have an answer to your #1 but I&#8217;m fairly certain there is no ombudsman on staff. Someone out there should correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. On #2 and being proactive, that process is happening where it can &#8212; and the shared priorities will help us answer where we should focus effort. And finally on #3 and accountability, I know of no campus where the president addresses the campus in this capacity. And if the adage of &#8220;leadership by example&#8221; rings true, what you desire is naturally happening as we speak.</p>\n<p>Regards, JM\n</p><p/></div>",

Work from RISD staff started with a webinar in August entitled &#8220;Think Outside the Bottle: A Webinar About Bottled Water Alternatives.&#8221; The webinar presented the case for replacing bottled water for tap water (which is safe, abundant and, relative to bottled water, inexpensive.) The EHS Department at RISD is interested in reducing the amount of bottled water at RISD to support a goal of reducing our carbon footprint. This is because basically for every gallon of bottled water purchased, about one quart of petroleum product is consumed in the process.</p>\n<p>For those interested, more information about the webinar is posted on the <a href=\"http://responsiblepurchasing.org\">Responsible Purchasing Network</a>.</p>\n<p>After the webinar, Dining, EHS and Academic Affairs staff, working with two students decided to hold a water taste comparison test. Two sessions were held; one in The Met at dinnertime and again at RISD&#8217;s Benefits Expo - both sessions were also attend by Providence Water Supply Board personnel and the Rhode Island Water Works Association. Results from the tests indicated that most tasters could not differentiate between unfiltered tap water, filtered tap water and Poland Springs bottled water. Actually, staff preferred regular chilled tap water over both filtered tap water and bottled water combined! Based on that data, we have now moved forward and installed (for trial purposes) two filtered water stations. These filtered water stations filter Providence tap water and then are able to chill or heat for hot beverages. Please stop by the second floor of What-Cheer Garage to try the water and voice your opinions and thoughts on these trial systems.</p>\n<p>For more information on these competitive systems visit <a href=\"http://stonybrookwater.com/\">stonybrookwater.com</a> and<br/><a href=\"vhttp://www.coolersmart.com/home.html\">www.coolersmart.com</a>.

They have no reservoir, like where the big plastic bottle sits on poland springs, for bacteria to grow. And the nozzle is recessed so that nothing will touch (bottle, nozzle, dirt) when the water comes out. </p>\n<p>Everything will be an improvement; we just have to figure out exactly how many are feasible and where and this will take two forms: office and public. Offices have more poland springs stations than are necessary or cost effective so we will be meeting with the staff council at the beginning of wintersession to determine how best to centralize the water system and transition office coolers to the new stations. This will determine the number of long-term stations we can place in public, high-traffic areas (i.e. design center lobby, college building, 161, etc.)\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As far as I can tell everyone who reads this blog or would bother to comment is in accord on this issue. So why is it that there are still water bottles everywhere on campus?</p>\n<p>I perceive that this problem stems largely from the new undergrad meal plan structure. Basically, in the past, the plan was a semester long debit where food was priced in dollars and deduced from the plan as the students ate. Typically students would have either no money left on the plan weeks before the end of term or hundreds of dollars left with which to feed those friends who were out. I was happy with this system until I had many hundreds left at the end of the year which simply evaporated when school was over. I admittedly bought my family all dinner when they picked me up and bought as many cookies as I could fit in my pockets in an attempt to finish the balance. </p>\n<p>But now, the plan is much different. It is based on points which roughly correspond to dollars and it is more or less a debit system in week long intervals where at the end of the week you loose those points [meals] unless you use them. And, from what I hear, this is largely where the proliferation of bottled water purchases comes from. Students feel &#8220;cheated&#8221; when they loose their unused points [read: money] at the end of the week and so they try to spend it any way they can. This leads to the purchase of casess of bottled water that can be stored unlike baked goods. </p>\n<p>I do not know how current meal plan participants feel about this system, but I was appalled to hear how many cases of bottled water they are buying in a sort of rebellious act against it. Frankly I think we have to go cold turkey and just suffer the consequences for a transition period in order to rid ourselves of this terrible habit of using bottled water. And it seems that this new water program with the metal bottles, and awareness posters and new fountains is our opportunity.\n</p><p/></div>",

I think one of the easiest and most important ways to improve our environmental impact is to lessen our use of plastics (which inevitably end up in the oceans, wildlife, and our bodies) by cutting out bottled water. I myself was guilty of drinking a lot of bottled water freshman year, in part because it was a way to feel like I was getting value out of the abundance of extra meals I had at the end of the week. In general I find the inflated cost of meal plans to be one of the biggest contributers to waste on campus. Because I was required to buy much higher meal plans than I needed (both freshman and sophomore year) it was often in my best interest financially to waste food. Now that I have no meal plan and pay for food entirely out of pocket, I NEVER throw away uneaten food. I save and eat it left over no matter what.\n</p><p/></div>",

I have contacted each vendor to get specific percent removals that are associated with their systems and both claim that lead removal is &gt; 99%.  To Ellen&#8217;s point, many older homes and buildings have lead piping in the service coming into the building from the water supply.  As you can see a very effective way to remove the lead is via filtration.  Interesting if you look at the Providence Water Supply 2007 water quality report you will see that there were exceedances in the Lead Action Levels that is causing Providence Water to initiate lead service line replacement.  These exceedances are not a result of the water delivered by Providence Water but by the piping associated with older houses and buildings.  Basically, even though Providence Water has little control over piping once it leaves their service they are regulated by EPA and must sample water in randomly selected houses that are connected to the water supply.  That really is one of the drivers for us at RISD to be looking at filtration instead of just water fountains or as we call them in RI &#8220;bubblers&#8221;.\n</p><p/></div>",

Each area has its own process to develop its proposal.</li>\n<li><strong>Feasibility and Adjustment</strong> <em>(December)</em> Budget proposals and assumptions are run through the budget model to determine what is required to balance the budget. The budget must balance. Necessary changes are discussed and agreed upon between the president and the presidential advisory council, each of whom works with her/his own areas through a variety of processes to refine and incorporate necessary changes. The final result of this iterative process becomes the proposed budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Board Approval</strong> <em>(January/February)</em> The proposed budget is submitted to the finance committee at its January meeting with a request for approval and a recommendation to the full board for approval at its February meeting.

I just was at the Student Alliance meeting where Maeda spoke and after listening to what people were saying about the current status of the school and future goals, one major topic struck me that I dont think has been discussed yet.</p>\n<p>There was discussion about social interactions between majors and how limited it is. I was more concerned with the fact that the academic interaction between majors is slim if not nonexistant. Majors are so separated and flexibility to even just be inspired by other majors regularly is limited to freshmen year. Artistic fields are becoming more and more interdisciplinary and what is expected of us as students and artists requires a more worldly type of artist than other points in history. I am not sure that RISD is taking advantage of this change. I can see this separation of majors very clearly in graphic design where we share a building with photography and yet there is no professional discussion or interaction. I just worry when I hear too much talk about professional training as preparation for the &#8220;real world&#8221; and having that be the main focus for school. I personally believe that the focus of school, and especially and art school such as RISD, should be about training creative thinkers who are using a material/major as a focus to problem solve think uniquely about art. I have suggestions for how I think that the social/artistic/academic gaps can be jumped but I am hoping that other RISD teacher and students are feeling the same way I am.</p></div>",

(I have family members who teach at Temple and they have enormous classes and will occasionally have 100 people in the same room all easily online simultaneously, viewing short web-based films.) </p>\n<p>And a further mystery is why it worked so much better last year. I have spoken occasionally with Ralph Fasano and indeed his team kindly came over early in the semester to help our class get connected; the problem is that throughout the semester, wireless connection, even after we cleared everyone&#8217;s laptops and followed all protocol correctly, was persistently unreliable, slow and weak. It has made for an awkward semester.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, my classes and my curricula have depended on connectivity and a robust connection for viewing films, motion and interactive pieces, online. Our department, especially in the grad program, REQUires our students to load their work onto Web sites. We rely on viewing the work from the web during studio hours. TO have this now basic and standard function so radically flawed this year has been a real detriment to learning and teaching.</p>\n<p>Back when we implemented the laptop program in GD, a big part of that initiative was to make a comprehensive plan for integrating the technology curricularly and pedagogically. So we outfitted our studios with screen, projectors, etc. Many faculty restructured their curricula inorder to use digital systems within our classes and I for one grew quite dependent on using the net as a place to store, view, seek, and discuss visual work.</p>\n<p>This semester I feel like I am teaching as I did back in 2000: pre lap-top initiative. It is certainly possible to do, and even occasionally refreshing, but it begs the question: do we want to be a school that has reliable and useful contemporary technology? In our dept we attempt to work with the full integration of both analog and digital environments. Working comfortably (and efficiently) side by side this is the ideal scenario and should be our goal. Perhaps we could share more information with OIT so they can better understand our curriular needs, and thereby work to bring our internet system closer to what our pedagogy requires. I would be happy to help with this. thanks.\n</p><p/></div>",

As new departments entered the program, we piggybacked with wireless coverage, based on the studio environment at the time.  During the last several years, we have expanded the wireless network in more public areas, (Library, Beach, etc.) and other departments, in response to individual demand. These wireless devices (access points) now number 160, not nearly enough for the expanded coverage we desire.</p>\n<p>CIT is one of our most blanketed buildings, so if there are some &#8220;dead&#8221; spots, please notify the local computer technician, so we can respond according.<br/>\nDesign Center on the other hand does have some locations where wireless coverage is not installed, but has limited coverage from &#8220;bleed&#8221; from floors above or below.  The ninth floor is one of those locations. However, (for now) we have identified several &#8220;wired&#8221; locations in Design Center where students could plug into the network for a much more stable, and robust network experience. </p>\n<p>Next steps: We have identified, evaluated, and selected the next generation of wireless networking for RISD (<a href=\"http://arubanetworks.com/applications/education_solutions.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aruba Networks</a> 802.11n solution) and have purchased additional access points and back-end equipment which will provide additional coverage with greater speed, and reliability. We are in the process of designing this next generation wireless environment, analyzing our buildings (including student dormitories) to determine exactly where the new access points should be installed. We are testing this new equipment and will begin installation pending final system design and equipment testing. As the design is finalized, additional building wiring will need to be installed to support of all new access points.</p>\n<p>Lucy, I would be happy to meet with you again to review your particular curricular requirements, which will assist us as we begin the implementation of the new wireless solution for the Design Center. </p>\n<p>We hope to begin the implementation soon and I will keep you updated on <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/oitservices.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">computing.risd.edu</a> and here on two.risd.edu.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br/>\nRalph\n</p><p/></div>",

I can imagine how little it is known around the globe considering how little it is known in our own country! The further you get from New England the less people know about RISD. I met with several companies this summer in Seattle,Wa and very few of them were familiar with RISD what-so-ever.<br/>\nI think offering exchange programs and sister school programs is a good solution to broaden RISDs academic name.<br/>\nWhat I am wondering, and am not sure if it fits completely with this thread,is if RISD could send out more feelers for job recruitment. Artworks has some postings coming from the opposite coast, even fewer from other countries. One thing I have noticed is that when RISD has job fairs and portfolio reviews it really only attracts companies from the North East. How can we attract businesses from outside RI, MA, NY?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I think Tino&#8217;s point about opportunities arising in China is an important one. I&#8217;ve lived the past 6 months in China; first doing an internship with a fashion company this summer in Xiamen and now on exchange with the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou. From my experience thus far, I think China is definetly economically growing at a fast pace right now (although, the bad economy is having a pretty substantial effect on China).<br/>\nIf we are to expand RISD and its design environment to such a country as China, one must consider some current &#8220;design issues&#8221; that I have seen (generally speaking). One is that the education system here is very different from the West. Students are disciplined from a very early age to think/study/act according to the textbooks in school. There is very little encouragment in &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221;. The reason behind this method is so that everyone can be trained in the &#8220;correct&#8221; way and they will be extremely sufficient at that. However, what happens is that when students go through college, they dont learn about problem solving skills as is so pertinent to our RISD education. I often hear people say &#8220;no, I&#8217;ve never done this before. Cant help you. Not possible&#8221; to simple problems such as printing photos 40&#8243; x 40&#8243; versus normal size. I think this is a core problem that needs to be addressed in China if it wants to continue to grow as a superpower. It needs to harvest designers and thinkers within its own country versus buying ideas from other countries (such as the Bird&#8217;s Nest in Olympic park). Culture and history definetly has its root in education, and through the past 40-50 years China has maintained its communist thinking. This is also why being creative is substantially harder here and finding a job that is creative even harder. For the mass of the Chinese, they do not think it is most important to find a job that one enjoys. Most of the people are still very poor, so making a living is all they care for. </p>\n<p>I think, we as the future of design, should think of solutions about how to bridge this creative gap b/w our two halves of the world. China today wants to find people (especially USA and Europe) that can bring something new to the table, so I think we should take advantage of this time!\n</p><p/></div>",

But, Korea might be better geographically.  Seoul is halfway between Tokyo and Beijing!  Number two would definitely be Denmark.  Nestled between the seas and coasts of Sweden, Norway and Germany - it&#8217;s not that far from the rest of Europe either!  India would round us out well at number three.  Recent events show India to be a little dangerous at the moment, but maybe ten to twenty years from now&#8230;  </p>\n<p>But y&#8217;know&#8230; RISD has a large international association with &#8220;55 participating institutions in 24 countries&#8221;!</p>\n<p>Our Ceramics department has hosted at least one international student every fall semester.  I know of only one student (dual-enrolled) in the department who has studied a full semester abroad alone, in the three years I have been here.  (I don&#8217;t count the Wintersession group-travel as international immersion study)  I think the real problem why RISDoids are largely unknown abroad comes down to simple economics.  </p>\n<p>Many (dare I say, probably ALL) of the international students that come here are coming from places where their education doesn&#8217;t cost over $40,000 a year.  How many RISDoids can really afford the added expense and stress of leaving the country for four months?  Common sense is hollering, &#8220;WHY are you going to go somewhere ELSE when you&#8217;re paying a FORTUNE to go HERE?!&#8221;</p>\n<p>So, RISD&#8217;s presence in other countries needs to be a real PRESENCE.  Not just one student struggling to figure out how to live, eat and finally get to work in 12 short weeks.  RISD would have to work more closely in conjunction with one or more of the &#8220;participating institutions&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>There should be mini-international study groups of 3-5 students that can attend a full semester abroad at the same institution, but not neccesarily same department.  There should be suitable housing accomodations for the length of their stay available upon arrival in the host country.   </p>\n<p>Lone art students struggling to meet their basic needs to survive and study in a strange country is no way for RISD to develop a presence.  A presence is made by moving in and getting noticed, not just passing through.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Mairead, a still diary is a fancy way of saying &#8220;taking loads of pictures&#8221;.  They are pretty great, as long as you don&#8217;t make freinds sit through the unedited folder full of images!  I had so many pictures of temples (you can&#8217;t help but trip over them in Japan) and not all are as spectacular as the next.  I barely scratched the surface with over six hundred photos, (and I spent a lot of time in the studio, forgoing extra exploration time). Maybe 100 were interesting and informative about the trip shots, and about two dozen were &#8220;postcard worthy&#8221;.  A still diary may also include any field sketching, miscellaneous writing, tourist pamphlets&#8230;  any information recorded about your trip that isn&#8217;t a video would count, really&#8230;\n</p><p/></div>",

To this end, we are starting up new projects, planning a workshop series, and raising awareness on campus. We would love to have you join us among other students, faculty, staff, and community partners at our kick-off event.</p>\n<p>We will explain what we have done so far as well as our vision for the future from both a student and faculty perspective.

Also regarding computers everyone in the RISD community needs to know that when a computer and other electronics such as printers, keyboards, etc..are finally no longer useful (broken, outdated) they need to be recycled.  We have a local company that recycles these in accordance with state and federal reg&#8217;s.  These machines are not sent to China or other places to &#8220;dump them&#8221; but recycled in the USA and Canada.

        "content": "<div><p>Finally had some time over the weekend to read the Sustainability proposal put together by members of Respond Design.  I think the thought process and work that went into this blueprint for sustainability is great and comprehensive in nature.  This document puts into writing the many discussions that we have had on campus over the past few years in Green Group meetings and plainly lays out the groundwork for continuation of that discussion.<br/>\nThere are a few mistakes (please don&#8217;t take this the wrong way - not criticizing the document), for example on Page 4 the document mentions RISD&#8217;s power plant as a cogeneration plant.  It is not a cogeneration plant; doesn&#8217;t change the point of the section, that by committing to burn natural gas instead of Number 6 oil we will reduce our carbon footprint.  Also the Chace Center is LEED certified and we in the Green Group have talked about LEED-EB certification for 15 Westminster Street but obviously that has not happened yet.<br/>\nI think the goals of the Presidents Climate Commitment are great for the nation and planet but I am not convinced we should sign the document.  Setting these goals in the uncertain economic times we presently find ourselves in could prove too costly and might set the stage for us to not make the deadlines in the program.  We should commit to many of the things that are outlined in the Commitment without actually signing it.  By us &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; the programs we can decide to take on the projects that make sense for RISD and in a time schedule that works for us.<br/>\nI do agree with the proposal that rather than buying carbon off-sets (Green Energy Certificates) we are spending money more wisely by investing in our infrastructure as a means to reduce GHG emissions.  Some of these ideas are outlined in the document &#8211; hybrid cars, commitment to burning natural gas, etc&#8230;<br/>\nI disagree with hiring a Director of Sustainability believing that we have the resources right now in-house to do this work.  Rather than a Director I think we need a commitment from the administration, faculty, managers, supervisors, staff and students at RISD to take on sustainability projects and then muscle resources to accomplish the goals we set.  This is attainable without a director if we have an active Sustainability Committee that meets regularly, assigns projects to specific groups (EHS, Facilities, etc.), reports to the administration on roadblocks to progress and reports annually in writing to the entire community.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As suggested by John M., here are my thoughts on software upgrades not just singling out Adobe CS4&#8230; I elaborated a bit<br/>\nReally wanted to address all software, coreware and non-coreware on campus. I have Cinema 4D R10 and Painter 9.5 in my lab and in talking to faculty have decided to not upgrade those. So coreware like Adobe and Final Cut would be great to look at, but there are other packages outside coreware that departments use. I intended to inspire the thought of holding off on upgrading those as well. Smaller savings, but $500-$1000 here and there might help all across campus.<br/>\nAlso some of the upgrades offered by software companies just complicate the teaching process. As a computer lab tech, I have had several comments from faculty that they are relieved that we still have CS3 and iMovie 6 on our machines. If the faculty is at times averse to software upgrades on software they need to teach, I think we need to investigate further. When we upgrade the labs it compels faculty and students to upgrade their software, spend more money and also upgrade on their learning curve, at times seemingly just to serve the wallets of the software companies. This not necessarily serving the art and design being created, and instead sometimes offering an obstacle to the art making. iMovie &#8216;08 would be an example where even Apple effectively admits, by offering iMovie &#8216;06 HD free to its iMovie 8 buyers, that it produced a shallow upgrade.<br/>\nI would also like to suggest thinking about how necessary the bells and whistles of that next software version relate to the core principles being taught with our design software. There will always be another version number on the all too near horizon.  We think that we have to keep up with the working world on everything to prepare our students for the workplace. Not so I would say with software. When I was Mass Art we didn&#8217;t have the very latest version of software and were instead taught the concepts of design making with the version we had, the capabilities of the software and not the minutiae.  We were then sent off to &#8221; grab a can of Jolt and hunker down with the QuickStart manual for a weekend&#8221;. Learned a lot more digging into the software on my own and with each necessary software release perused quickstart guides or tutorials online to catch up with the latest stuff.  I think the best we can teach is to learn how to learn.  I started early with this concept and it has served me well. A personal exampIe: I got my first computer job at a CD-ROM publisher in 1993 convincing my employer that I could use a Mac or a PC based on my experiences with an Amiga computer. I was right, quickly learning these other operating systems with my own self taught crash course.  In a year I was in charge of building Web-Hybrid CDROM databases &amp; customer technical support for this small software company. Learned to learn and kept up with changes.<br/>\nFinally I would guess that the business world would not be in a rush to purchase software upgrades given the economic crisis. Thus we could ease off.<br/>\n-Paul V.\n</p><p/></div>",

As a undergrad or grad student, you&#8217;re more likely than not using the labs quite a bit and can get by with whatever version they are on. When I went to RISD, I lived in the labs and never bought software.</p>\n<p>For CE, most of the students prefer to work at home (I would say probably over half), and purchase the software. You can&#8217;t buy CS3 anymore, so they buy CS4. Flash, Illustrator and After Effects do not play well with older versions of themselves (and these are coincidentally what I teach). Luckily, you can save down in Flash and Illustrator, but not After Effects. The version in the lab is not yet updated. It makes teching problems and reviewing work a bit problematic. As more and more students upgrade&#8211;while the labs do not&#8211;it forces me as a teacher to buy the software just so I have access to the newest version for helping the students.</p>\n<p>Nevermind that I&#8217;ve heard Flash CS4 has a significant interface change, which makes going between labwork/homework even more difficult. I have to give blind advice, since I don&#8217;t even know what they are looking at when they have problems. </p>\n<p>I know CE won&#8217;t upgrade for awhile, and I&#8217;ll eventually learn what the most common problems are and have answers for them (even without owning CS4). I don&#8217;t think the answer is to upgrade all the labs. But it&#8217;s not an easy feet for me to purchase all the programs either. Since I teach so many programs, I have to buy the whole package (AE, PS, AI, DW, FL) and need FCP as well. I think we all have a rough idea what that costs on an individual level.</p>\n<p>However, I will say that the forced upgrading schedule keeps me really fresh professionally and I usually know a few more features than my competitors. When it comes to crunch time, the ability to make a render farm, or use some cross-software workflow trick really helps me out. </p>\n<p>That was longer than I wanted it to be, and I don&#8217;t think CE&#8217;s answers are necessarily the rest of the campus. But I just wanted to put in my experience with the whole software upgrading system.\n</p><p/></div>",

Over the past year, we have introduced, or are about to introduce, three online courses - Build Your Online Portfolio, Web Architecture and HTML 1. So far, our experience has been positive. But any decision to develop online education in a serious way will require a real investment in both infrastructure and staff, none of which comes cheaply. Please note that Berklee College of Music invested almost 8 million dollars to get their program off the ground and did not see any return on that investment for several years. The EVP for Administration and Finance has rightly asked for a detailed financial viability plan before even considering such a proposal. Therefore, CE is in a very early phase of trying to accumulate facts and figures that will demonstrate the financial viability of non-credit online education. The current economic landscape makes us both ever more interested in the potential rewards of online education and ever more cautious about the potential downside.\n</p><p/></div>",

The first time I stepped into the Residence Life office, it sounded like a circus I didn&#8217;t want to be involved in.

RISD needs to emphasize the RIPTA deal more with incoming students, and beef up their Off-Campus Housing assistance in Residence Life.  </p>\n<p>RISD will never be able to buy and maintain enough buildings to be able to provide on campus housing for everyone.  Why not create new job positions instead?  Hire more people to help students find off campus housing.</p>\n<p>Six months ago, I moved far enough away from campus to make the bus commute neccessary every day.  I wish I&#8217;d done it sooner!  I needed more apartment than what I could afford closer to campus, and there are many students just like me.  I would have walked or used the RISD Saferide anywhere within a mile radius.

The campus took on a triangular shape, and we lost the cluster of RISD buildings being together.   With this new floor plan came the RISD Saferide, to insure safety for students walking through the downtown area late at night.     What type of cost has Saferide brought about?  I realize eliminating Saferide is not a possibility, but perhaps a reduction in need would save money.<br/>\nWouldn&#8217;t our graduate students better enjoy the river waterfront view from South Main Street, perhaps the upstairs space of the storefronts south of BEB, already owned by RISD?     Such a change would return the campus floor plan to the east side, making RISD a campus of 3 parallel lines extending from South Main St. through Benefit St, and to Prospect St.  RISD buildings would return to being a continuous cloak for campus navigators.<br/>\nWalking to CIT/Mason is typically a 10-minute one-way walk which involves leaving the heart of the RISD campus and journeying through the business district of downtown.  This is a very different feel from walking to other campus buildings.  Some may enjoy the feel this provides, but multiply the 10-minute walk by the number of people walking to that building every day.  What type of time/cost savings could be generated by the Graduate building being more closely connected to the heart of the campus?<br/>\nAlso, although the real estate market is weak,   Johnson and Wales would be a viable buyer with their campus buildings already surrounding CIT/Mason.<br/>\nHappy New Year RISD!\n</p><p/></div>",

I couldn&#8217;t foresee even moving to 35 hours as feasible for the amount of work I have to do, let alone 32.  </p>\n<p>2.  Losing 8 hours per week, for me,would result in $160 less per week, or $320 per bi-weekly paycheck, or $8,320 annually.  Since I am unmarried / single-income, this kind of loss would severely affect my ability to pay my mortgage.  Frankly, I&#8217;d have to start looking for work elsewhere.

Prior to my arrival as president, the fundraising focus was on the largely capital-intense projects like the Mandle Living Learning Center and the Chace Center. In the wake of that incredible capital campaign, there is significant &#8220;donor fatigue&#8221; as it is appropriately called. We are currently vectoring RISD fundraising towards academic passion and scholarship support with an emphasis on building alumni giving as evidenced by the new and improved <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/giving\" rel=\"nofollow\">giving site</a> launched in Dec of 2008. We&#8217;re in a big boat, so turning the ship will take time. But that turn is now in progress. </p>\n<p>2/ With respect to the city and state, a key issue often raised in my conversations with the Governor and Mayor is the question of why RISD (and Brown etc) students don&#8217;t stay in this area. A <a href=\"http://thebiggestlittle.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">brilliant effort</a> led by local folks and RISD student <b>Brendan Ravenhill</b> wrt the advantages of living in Providence has begun, and I have been personally reaching out to the entrepreneurial community in this area and with the Chamber of Commerce. FYI I&#8217;ve been trying to recruit small companies to move to Providence &#8212; if there are certain companies that RISD students think we want to attract to Providence please do a shout out. Also, Prof Byrne points out the good work (and your work Michael) of <a href=\"http://www.risdpublicengagement.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPE</a>. There are many things being done by RISD faculty, students, staff here in Providence that are largely undocumented. If anyone knows things in this category please do post.

Your question, however, has to do with the way in which we refer to &#8220;essential employees&#8221; in our Staff Handbook.  We define this in our handbook under our Inclement Weather Policy, but it applies to other situations, such as the Holiday party.</p>\n<p>&#8230;&#8221;Essential services include those provided by Facilities, Public Safety, Dining Services and on-call Residence Life staff.   Because these departments are expected to remain operational, employees within these departments are expected to report to work even when RISD is closed. Depending on the circumstances, other personnel may also be required to report to work.  Managers have the responsibility to identify work roles deemed essential and to inform affected individuals in advance of their obligation. &#8221;</p>\n<p>If you are unsure as to whether your job is considered essential under this definition, please speak to your supervisor.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nCandace\n</p><p/></div>",

As I have mentioned before, RISD has all &#8220;Design&#8221; students on laptop programs, but somehow we find ourselves, or at least those who live on campus, without wireless internet in the dorms.  I have discussed this with a few people, and would like to see something done about it.  I greatly appreciate RISD_ROAMABOUT, however slow and unreliable it is sometimes, and would like to see it extend to the dorms.  I somehow find it ridiculous that sophisticated students with (upwards of $5000) computers are chained to one outlet in each dorm room, without the ability to even take it to their lounge.  One wireless router for the Quad and for 15 West should easily clear this all up. thanks for listening.\n</p><p/></div>",

Wireless coverage at RISD has grown, in large part, and in conjunction with, the RISD Laptop Program. We have also expanded coverage to many common spaces and more recently RISD Beach.<br/>\nHowever, we are at a point where the wireless technology is changing (for the better - and faster) so we are evaluating vendors and designing a strategy for future implementation.  I will keep you informed as we move forward with more ubiquitous wireless access across campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

At that meeting both audiences suggested we alert the students to what is happening &#8230; so by posting on this blog we start that process. Here is a quick 3-minute voice summary of what the meetings covered: <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/risd_budgetupdate2.mp3\" title=\"risd_budgetupdate2.mp3\">risd_budgetupdate2.mp3</a>. If you have any questions please append them to this blog strand. We ended each of the sessions with a Q/A format and the continued promise of not leaving until all questions were answered. And we did.</p>\n<p>Please note that in the &#8220;What&#8217;s Next&#8221; slide we refer to gathering our <i>shared priorities</i> over the next coming months. I personally started this discussion with the Faculty Steering Committee, Department Heads, and Deans in a &#8220;talk out loud and listen out loud&#8221; format; in addition I&#8217;ve engaged many groups around campus including the Student and Grad Student Alliance, Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, and many more. I&#8217;ve also interviewed a variety of faculty views around campus on video including Professors Henry Ferreira, Mairead Byrne, Peter Tagiuri, Rosanne Somerson, Ken Horii and I hope to expand that collection as I continue to collect data. Over the next few months I look forward to working together with much of the campus on putting this picture together. </p>\n<p>The year&#8217;s almost ending, so in the last few dwindling days I wish you a Happy December 2008, and look forward to seeing all of you in the new year of 2009.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br/>\nJohn</p></div>",

He appreciated all the open communication happening here at RISD on this blog, but then expressed concern as to how it turns into action. I let him know how I have simply stated <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/maedas-three-resolutions/\">personal goals</a> here at RISD &#8212; central to my core thesis has been that I want to listen as much as possible. So I am listening to everything that is happening here on <i>Two.</i> And I do this in my face-to-face encounters with folks on campus as well. There are so many things to do here at RISD so all issues cannot be resolved, but I wanted the student to know that much of what I hear eventually turns into an action of some form &#8212; whether it be an email or telephone call to someone here or outside of RISD, or simply making me rethink a thought I might have had that would otherwise gone untested. </p>\n<p>So the communication that happens here and around RISD are key inputs to how I understand RISD as your President. Thanks for helping to shape RISD&#8217;s future by speaking up *and/or* by coming to this blog just to listen. Coming to hear something new and interesting at RISD, and then sharing it with a colleague is speaking <i>outwards</i> &#8212; which is a fabulous complement to speaking <i>up</i>. The power of communication is an amazing thing &#8212; it is what holds together our vital sense of community. </p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s an important year for our country. So when you think about how we are designing RISD&#8217;s future together through ample communication channels, we&#8217;re also designing the USA&#8217;s future too. And the world will prosper for our combined efforts. Happy new year, -John</p></div>",

So I&#8217;m happy to tell a little bit about my (long-winded, sorry!) journey to RISD if it may be of any help.</p>\n<p>Ironically, as much as I enjoyed all of my high school art classes I had no intention of applying to an art school at the time.  I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to study, but I knew that it wasn&#8217;t going happen in Mass where I grew up.  So I headed to the University of Colorado at Boulder because I loved the mountains there.  With three brothers and not a lot of money under my parents&#8217; roof I took a year off after high school, worked in Colorado and gained residency there so I could take advantage of the cheaper in-state tuition.</p>\n<p>I took as many arts and sciences classes as was possible without declaring a major and was still not sure what field to go forward with.  What happened next one could argue was pure chance, but in retrospect I think it happened because I had my &#8220;radar&#8221; on full alert.  In other words, I knew I didn&#8217;t want to be at CU anymore and through word of mouth I came across an amazing job opportunity I had to leave school to pursue.  After two years working full-time I was now age 24 and still very happy with my job prospects.  But I knew that the longer I waited to go back and finish my degree (if at all), the harder it might be.  So I saved some money and left on good terms with my employer.  In fact, I&#8217;m confident that his letter of recommendation played a big role in my art school applications (i.e. never burn your bridges!).</p>\n<p>So before I started applying to schools I first had to get something out of my system: travel.  With the money I saved from the last months at my job I bought a plane ticket to Bangkok and spent a month backpacking through Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.  It was an exhilarating experience; I would recommend it to anyone.</p>\n<p>Upon return from Asia I immediately enrolled in drawing and painting classes at a community college and started building a portfolio.  This step was crucial for me because I was now much more interested in &#8220;learning&#8221; drawing and painting than I was in high school.</p>\n<p>I then visited and was accepted to a handful of art schools around the country, but didn&#8217;t really get the right vibe from any of them.  I intentionally did not apply to RISD in this first round of applications because I grew up 30 min. north and just didn&#8217;t like what I could remember of Providence as a kid.  BUT I eventually came and checked it out and it just all of a sudden felt right.  Thankfully RISD came through and here I am, absolutely loving it.</p>\n<p>So the only advice I would have for prospective art school students is to take ten years to get a degree!  Just kidding.  I would not recommend that.  But by sufficiently allowing yourself whatever time you need to enter into a program like RISD&#8217;s, all the more you may bring to the table when the time IS right for that essay and portfolio to come as personally and naturally as they should.</p>\n<p>Mike Stoddard\n</p><p/></div>",

Since these are from the City of Providence, and not public safety, each ticket is $100. I am Broke. From what I can tell, there are no students lots on campus, or at least centrally-located lots. Also, it is apparently illegal to park on most streets within the vicinity without a permit. Is there a permit system in place for students? If not, perhaps RISD can look into securing parking space for students, or issuing permits.<br/>\nAlternately, perhaps RISD can pay my parking tickets?

I&#8217;m a faculty member but have never used the RISD parking lots because I couldn&#8217;t afford the money.  I&#8217;ve been here 7 years and come in every day, more or less, or a few times a day.  I always use unmetered street parking, usually parking on Congdon Street and walking 10 or 5 minutes depending on where I park.  In that time, I&#8217;ve had about 3 tickets for $25 or so, one of which I successfully contested.  I&#8217;ve also had a couple of dings in the car from snow or another car (the driver of which left a note).  So, I think parking on the street is a reasonable, manageable strategy.  I fall a lot and usually have a fair amount to carry, so there is a downside to walking around hilly Providence.  And I know the time will come when I won&#8217;t be able for it.  But so far so good.<br/>\nMairead\n</p><p/></div>",

Also, it&#8217;s cheaper than dealing with tickets, and less stressful than street-parking-hunting.<br/>\n2. Take a look at the streets around campus and find the ones that are not permit-parking only.  The have to make College Street permit only, think about how many people would want to park there.  However, if you drive around especially south on Benefit, there are tons of different streets that are only no parking before 10 or after 4:30.  You get the idea.</p>\n<p>RISD makes it very clear that parking is very sparse on the hill.  However, they are nice enough to open up the parking lots for late nights/weekends, which is much appreciated.  Otherwise, I don&#8217;t really feel that this is something they need to act on.  Parking in Providence is pretty horrible regardless.\n</p><p/></div>",

I studying chemistry in college and then working for a chemical manufacturer/distributor and then working at a manufacturing company that making a huge array of products I can tell you that the materials used to make art at RISD are not that much different from those used in industry.  We have furnaces to make glass, ceramics and cast metal - so does industry.  We paint a variety of substrates - so does industry.  We make jewelry - so does industry.  The comparisons could go on and on.  To your question, RISD does a lot when it comes to protecting our staff and students and the environment from exposures to chemical hazards.  Most of these materials are used responsively by the RISD community but to your point if used inappropriately or incorrectly this could lead to problems.  For example, some of the finishes used on furniture if not applied in an adequately designed spray booth could lead to exposures with both acute (immediate) and chronic (long term) health effects.  Likewise if we did not have proper disposal for unused and spent solvents from that same process we would also have environmental issues.  As a discussion point, I will be forwarding to the RI Dept of Labor the week after next a listing of over 600 chemical compounds (glues, paints, oils, solvents&#8230;) that are used at RISD.  I invite you to come by my office in College Building at anytime to discuss specific concerns you have about artistic materials.  I also invite any group that wants to further improve our safety and environmental programs to contact me.\n</p><p/></div>",

My understanding of the situation is that no department is funded to maintain or stock/furnish the booth, attempted repairs have failed, and the situation is wrapped up in some sort of beauracracy. I was told that it could not be resolved by the sculpture department. I don&#8217;t believe that I am speaking alone in saying that this is an essential facility for the students who work in Metcalf.

Basically, what are all my fellow illustration and painting students who paint at home doing with their [insert carcinogenic here] waste?

I was excited to see a small screen in the Metcalf Store advertising certain products there as &#8220;green&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d suggest that RISD have some talks on environmental and personal safety concerning art materials. A lot of major safety issues can be resolved with common sense, but there are many ambiguities when it comes to waste disposal and recycling. It seems that dilution or the small size of many things we do allows us to gloss over concerns about cleanup or fumes or exposure hazards. I think that most students would benefit in the long run from being more informed about the materials they will be using during school and for the rest of their working careers.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I would like to address Michael&#8217;s observations and questions first.  The EPA wrote into regulations that household wastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulations.  This means that what RISD does on campus relative to wastes (collection, storage, inspections, disposal, etc..) does not have to be done in a private residence.  This does not mean the materials are any less toxic or hazardous it just means those regulations do not apply.  It also doesn&#8217;t give license to dispose of these materials down the drain or in the trash it just means the regulations that apply to RISD do not apply to a residence.  Interesting the EPA considers wastes from dorms and outer houses exempt from the regulations just like those wastes generated in other homes and apartments.  The EHS Department at RISD has written in conjunction with other groups several documents that address the concerns of artists.  One in particular is for Fine Arts painters, see the following web link - <a href=\"http://www.narrabay.com/Documents/PDFs/ArtistBMP.pdf.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.narrabay.com/Documents/PDFs/ArtistBMP.pdf.</a>  Another document called Safety Guide for Art Studios addresses broader art studio issues, not just paintings and is available on RISD&#8217;s EHS website at the following address - <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/Default.aspx?d=Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety&amp;eid=898&amp;id=1928&amp;hid=892&amp;aid=1290&amp;lid=896&amp;did=890&amp;pid=894.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/Default.aspx?d=Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety&amp;eid=898&amp;id=1928&amp;hid=892&amp;aid=1290&amp;lid=896&amp;did=890&amp;pid=894.</a>  These two documents should answer many questions you might have.  I hope this response helps and please feel free to contact EHS with any issues or concerns about safety and environmental issues on or off our campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

I work with Alan in the EHS department (been here since September 2008) and one part of my job entails maintaining  students&#8217; workspaces around campus with respect to environmental, health and safety.</p>\n<p>That being said, the timing of this thread is impeccable! We had scheduled several weeks ago to have a waste company come in today (Thursday 1/29) to revitalize the red solvent cans in the Quad workrooms, Fletcher, and ISB studios. We&#8217;re going to clean out the solid gunk (mostly rags and paper towels) that&#8217;s stuck inside, clean the outsides of the cans, and relabel them so they&#8217;re fresh and more accessible. In the future, students can help us by not putting wipes and debris in these cans. The only thing that should go in them are solvents. Also in the works for the next few weeks is a revamp of the EHS information boards in the Quad workrooms (the boards elsewhere are in pretty good condition).</p>\n<p>As for the South Hall spray booth, I&#8217;ve remounted the posters that detail RISD&#8217;s spray booth policy in all the spray booths in the Quad. They&#8217;ve been reinstalled up on the walls right by the booths, for easy viewing by users. Hopefully this will alleviate the problem of solvent fumes in the dorms. Again, students can help our efforts by respecting the postings and not painting over them.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget, if you or anyone else have environmental or health concerns, you can always give us a call, send us an email, or stop by our office in the College Building. We&#8217;re right inside the door under the arch, in front of the elevator.\n</p><p/></div>",

It will be a great opportunity for students to have fun, get some entertainment from watching people get pied in the face, and it will also serve as a social opportunity where student get to interact with the RISD community.  We have enlisted some willing souls from the Reslife staff, Office of Student Life staff, and Public Safety officers.  These various participants will be raffled off and one lucky student will get the chance to pie them in the face.  We will be selling raffle tickets on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 6:00-7:30pm at the Met for $1 per raffle ticket.  There will be ponchos provided for protection, paper towels and wet wipes, and the pies will be whipped cream in pie tins.  We were hoping to enlist some more faculty volunteers or just spread the word about the event.  But ultimately we were hoping that John Maeda would be willing to participate.  Let me stress that faculty will only be hit by a pie once and there will be protection so you will stay relatively clean with the exception of your head.</p>\n<p>We are expecting a large turn out of both students and faculty as this event and there is almost no doubt that a lot of money will be raised.  I hope we can count John Maeda in on this but if not, I hope he could at least come and watch!</p></div>",

But I do know it&#8217;s possible to do unpaid internships over the summer there, and sometimes they can be paid (although in these economic times it would be hard).

So this is a designer sharing his ideas with a fellow comrade of the design world.</i></p>\n<p>RISD is dying to me. As much as I have fallen in love with this great place of sanctuary, it hurts me to say that my love of the school is at a place where I feel as though our love has to be put on hold. Its not the school itself, just the environment I am currently apart of. My friends and I are slowly going our separate ways. Having fellow designers as a part of an artist&#8217;s life is a very important part of being a designer I feel. The importance of sharing ideas and getting constant criticism is important. But I feel that once this RISD experience is over all of that goes away because graduates would seem to likely go their own ways and forget the awesome companionship created here among an elite class of people. Having confidence in my design is influenced by the criticism I get from my friends. When I believe in a project and my friends support me, the following critique always goes the right way. I try hard to keep my friends together by throwing get-togethers in my apartment or having everyone meet up at the MET to have dinner with. All my efforts seem to be in vain now. I don&#8217;t know if its me not being as enthusiastic anymore and that is directly displacing itself to the people around me. Where is all this confidence going? Why am I slowly losing the confidence in myself and the people around me? What happens to the great elite and why do we have to fall? Why cannot this community rule the world? I feel its the designers job to change each other, not the designer himself/herself. The world is dying to know us. Why do we have to go in it alone?</p>\n<p>I appreciate your time to read this President. Hope it can help with what you plan on doing with RISD. This is a great community. I love it too much to see the product of a design school to be a project done last minute and not with the fullness of the heart of RISD.</p>\n<p>Hello XYZ, The feelings you might feel during your senior year in college are quite common. It&#8217;s that moment where everyone is about to go on their separate ways. That said, there&#8217;s a lot you can do about making your experience leaving RISD as wonderful as the moment when you arrived. Our Student Affairs office as led by interim Associate Provost Barbara Fienman (bfienman@risd.edu) is the office that is charged with connecting the student body. Have you reached out to her office? Thanks for making contact, and know that building community is all about communicating. It&#8217;s as simple, and as hard, as that. Regards, JM\n</p><p/></div>",

This is the first step in the evolution of risd.edu that we will undertake this year: the rest of the site also will be completely overhauled. We are happy with this beginning. &#9786;</p>\n<p>Eric Meier<br/>\nDirector of Interactive Media, Media + Partners</p>\n<p>P.S.

From my understanding of the current implementation, it simply uses Google to search through, and is not a dedicated internal search engine.</p>\n<p>2) I feel that the integration between the various RISD department websites and the official RISD site is critical design point. Right now, there is a link at the bottom right that opens up the various department (and RISD related) links. Would you consider having a submenu on the main control pane that would expand to list the various RISD departments? Or perhaps make the link more visible/clear to first time users, who may be looking for a specific department and would like to navigate to it from the main RISD site?</p>\n<p>3) The Flash snapshots of different news events at RISD is a great idea. However, in its current implementation I find it a bit cumbersome. The reason for this is that it does not have a visual marker to show which news or event segment it is showing. If I barely missed one of the events as user, I would have to wait until all of them cycle through until I can get back to the one that I wish to click on and get more information about.  An example of what I am talking about can be found at <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com,\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nvidia.com,</a> where you can see the 4 rectangles representing each of the news events, and you can simply click on each one to jump directly to that section.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to thank you for your hard work on the new design.

        "content": "<div><p>Anonymous:</p>\n<p>As reported here in December, we have been working with our Network Vendor in a detailed radio frequency (RF) analysis of our campus. The data gathered in the analysis was used to design the new wireless network including the placement of wireless access points (APs). In many identified locations, older or no network wiring exists to support the new access points.  We have also interviewed the occupants of many building as part of the wireless design process.<br/>\nAlthough this has taken longer than anticipated, we now have those plans for moving forward with the next generation RISD Wireless Network as follows:</p>\n<p>Phase I: Replace Existing wireless footprint, College Building, Student Residence Halls. </p>\n<p>We purchased new Aruba 802.11n APs and have begun the implementation of a phased approach to progressively improve our campus wireless footprint.  During this month (January 2009) we replaced our existing wireless equipment (160 APs) with the Aruba equipment.  This equipment will give us valuable data for performance, signal strength and wireless range for all subsequent wireless phases. Broader implementation of additional APs is planned for a later phase, this summer / fall. </p>\n<p>Equipment Testing: OIT in conjunction with all departmental technical support staff have begun to define all operational parameters of this new system &#8211; particularly as related to PC and MAC laptop configurations &#8211; to help ensure a smooth transition to the new equipment. </p>\n<p>As is the case on many campuses, much of our existing building wiring is older, and does not support the higher speed throughput necessary for this new technology. We will install new wiring where needed. In order to lower our external wiring costs, OIT has partnered with RISD&#8217;s Facilities staff to provide new internal building wiring in support of this process.</p>\n<p>OIT has also engaged external wiring contractors to assist with some of our more challenging building structures, such as College Building, 15 West, and Colonial Apartments, which are included in the first phase of our implementation.</p>\n<p>Next Steps: We continue to test some of the more advanced security enhancements of this new technology.  However our intention is to activate some student dormitories beginning this spring semester (Carpenter, Condon, Nickerson, wiring 90% complete - others as wiring is completed) using our existing environment (risd-roamabout).  Our goal is to plan a new, more secure wireless network subsequently.</p>\n<p>Phase II: Our intentions are to continue to acquire and implement additional APs over the summer and into the fall with a goal of expanded wireless coverage to the campus. </p>\n<p>We will continue to post information on the blog and computing.risd.edu as as we progress with building wiring and installation of new APs.</p>\n<p>Ralph\n</p><p/></div>",

I love that Monique points out the Intranet&#8217;s Computing section as many of the issues referred directly to those pages.</p>\n<p>- I met with Steve Boudreau, Erik Quimby and Ian Lyons (all from OIT) at 4PM to review what we knew about the problems being reported, what we didn&#8217;t and how we could methodically solve the problem. We have a tentative plan in place that we&#8217;ll start working tomorrow.</p>\n<p>- We have not yet identified a cause for the network drop-offs. Will, I will need your help, and other students, to identify users who can work with us to 1) review their existing system for possible clues and more importantly 2) maintain open communication with our working group as we try specific solutions to identify what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Think of them as clinical trials. We&#8217;d just do them all but then we won&#8217;t know the precise cause/solution. That&#8217;s a valuable piece of knowledge for a full resolution.

It has been determined that a system wide configuration change is needed to resolve the problem.  OIT is planning to make the adjustment this Friday, February 20th at 2:00 AM.  A complete system wide reset is required and all wireless access will be unavailable for approximately 30 minutes while the work is performed. </p>\n<p>Ralph\n</p><p/></div>",

We are attempting to reduce our supporting wiring costs (each wireless connection requires an actual wire to connect) by using in-house staff, but 15 west will require hiring outside wiring contractors to assist with the supporting wiring.  We have identified three such &#8220;complex&#8221; buildings: 15 West, Colonial, and Dwight House. We are making progress with all student dormitories and we are projecting all dormitories will be completed by late summer, early fall.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br/>\nRalph\n</p><p/></div>",

This will require at least one blog post per day as well as reaching out to existing communities and encouraging their participation.</p>\n<p>June 17 - September 10. The content director will serve as &#8220;online ambassador&#8221; between the daily events taking place in Linz&#8217;s main square and the online community that has been cultivated since February. In addition to the art installations in the main square, each week will include a series of events like school-to-school interactions, expert talks, concerts, and meals. The online content director will be expected to help integrate the online presence with the main square display, and to attend and document these events on the website.</p>\n<p>It is the perfect gig for the perfect person, but the sooner the better. Please email a brief letter of interest and your CV to <a href=\"mailto:michael@naimark.net\">michael@naimark.net</a> .\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi, Aaron: Grants and Fellowships - once separate things - have largely merged into a single set of fiscal resources which can be used for a wide variety of goals. Enrolled students tend to hear more about those for travel experiences (Fulbright, Watson or Gelman as examples) largely because funding organizations offer the awards to students as they graduate. But there are many different kinds: the major distinctions are those for individuals versus those for organizations; those for educational versus experiential goals; and the funding scale - the size of the award. The one area grants shy away from funding is capital expenses.  Career Services lists notable art and design grants in advance of their deadlines but creatively researching your specific goals can yield an array of possibilities. Great places to start: <a href=\"http://www.nyfa.org/login.asp?id=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYFA Source</a> and the <a href=\"http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/fundingsources/gtio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foundation Center</a>.

One of the initiatives we started was to require our customers to transfer their food into a to-go container only after they had paid for it. We regularly saw customers eating out of to go containers in the dining room and then throwing them away. &#160;Our thinking was that by inserting a conscious thought into service, folks would make a decision to use a paper to go container only when they were traveling with there food. We also thought that it would be okay to let students living in 15 west take the plates, cups and flatware to their apartments and return them when they were done. That also would help us to be successful in reducing our over all waste.</p>\n<p>We seem to have been wrong on both accounts. What has happened is that the plates have all been taken along with our flatware, plastic tumblers and ceramic mugs that two students worked so hard to make for us last year. And while the paper to-go container use had decreased at first, without plates to put food on for service we were forced to use paper plates or to-go containers, which defeated the whole point.</p>\n<p>So at the holiday break we decided to replenish our china inventory and let our customers receive the to-go container when they order their meal in hopes that they might take that option instead of taking our plates, bowls, flatware, tumblers and mugs. We were very clear all along in our signage and communication to our customers as to our intentions, goals and hardships. Very little has worked and again we find ourselves with no dishes and having to rely on paper plates as we head into second semester.</p>\n<p>As the chef/manager of the portfolio I see my staff working day in and day out with amazing pride, ownership and skill in providing the best experience that they can for our customers and our school as a whole. While you may not always agree with our decisions, they all come from the heart and are meant to be positive and have an important impact both on how we are perceived and our role in the community and the world.</p>\n<p>What I am asking is for is a dialog with all of you to help me solve this problem. We want our dishes, we need our dishes. Please take the time to bring them back to us or help us find an alternative solution. &#160;Please help us.</p>\n<p>tim</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As a non 15-West resident,</p>\n<p>I suggest posting signs requesting a final return of plates with a one week window. Indicate that all 15 west residents (these being almost unilaterally responsible for the problem) will be charged a fee for replacement of the plates/cutlery. If you don&#8217;t get back 75% (or whatever number you think is appropriate), charge all students living in 15 West a flat fee. You should  derive the fee from the cost of one complete set of plates/cutlery per person. I imagine 15 dollars, which goes well with the name of the building too.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the Romans killing every tenth soldier to inspire discipline, but applied to cutlery instead.</p>\n<p>That said, from a student point of view, RISD dining services is ridiculous when it comes to food pricing and that damages students&#8217; respect for the different dining services. You can get a tiny block of tempeh for $7, you can get a packaged yogurt at the Watermark for something like $1.70, prices on produce and most packaged items are crazy. Buying a meal using points or cash can quickly add up to fifteen dollars or more if you are trying to have some variety. I&#8217;d note that this begins to fall into the price range of the cafeteria at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I understand the idea of marking these things up to cover labor costs for example, but tripling (at least) the cost of a yogurt is not very respectable in the eyes of students footing the bill. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also cite the draconian meal plan requirements as a big issue. It&#8217;s clear that it&#8217;s excessively large for some freshmen (witness the buying of all the poland spring on thursdays), and requiring on-campus sophomores and others to sign on is pretty blatantly extortionist, considering how cheaply it is possible to obtain food around providence with a little effort/biking. </p>\n<p>As a simplistic example, I am currently on the 12 plus meal plan. With a little rusty math it looks like I am putting 80 dollars a week into food not counting points, for a meal price of about $6.60. This is actually an okay value if my math is correct. However, I could obtain my own groceries at any number of venues in Providence and make exactly what I want to eat for between 20 and 60 dollars, depending on how vegetarian and how borgeouis I want the food to be.

        "content": "<div><p>When I arrived on campus I asked a similar question to Jeremy about how the food at RISD was priced and learned that competitive pricing is in place &#8212; i.e. it is set in relation to other available options within a reasonable radius from the center of RISD. I took some data by eating lunch in the vicinity at non-RISD places and discovered that the costs were similar. It&#8217;s useful to look at a principle from economics around the price of a Big Mac in different vicinities in the world. Here&#8217;s a link that explains that <a href=\"http://www.oanda.com/products/bigmac/bigmac.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">theory</a> &#8212; a quite good one at that. </p>\n<p>FYI Most of my lunches are eaten either at the Watermark or Portfolio and I get dinner at the Met from time to time. The food quality at MIT was terrible so I actually am pleased by the high quality of food here at RISD &#8212; so much so that I eat it regularly so I know what&#8217;s going into the stomachs of my students. Also incidentally I get comments from students at other school that are visiting RISD that they are surprised by the quality of the food.</p>\n<p>Regarding meal plans, I used to be in a meal plan as a student and recall the advantages and disadvantages. One thing I&#8217;ve learned as president is that the principle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;economies of scale&#8221;</a> is in place. The point of mandatory meal plans is to keep prices of food down because purchasing power is achievable &#8212; i.e. food can be bought for a lower price when you buy it in larger quantities. </p>\n<p>Ginny is quite a genius at trying to make our food at RISD organic and healthier way way way above average. And she&#8217;s conscious of keeping prices at a reasonable level so your comment is probably percolating in her fabulous mind.</p>\n<p>With respect to Tim&#8217;s concern about plates and flatware disappearing, aside from the cost issue from a sustainability perspective it&#8217;s just embarrassing. If you care about being green RISD, then let the plates be reused through the system properly. </p>\n<p>My friend <a href=\"http://www.mcdonough.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bill McDonough</a> always advocates that the only way to manage sustainability for real is not to consider &#8220;recycling&#8221; of objects (like aluminum cans going back into aluminum &#8212; which takes lots of energy), but instead consider that re-use is the only true form of sustainability (choosing to simply reuse the can requires no energy at all).</p>\n<p>Thanks RISD, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

I bet the disappearance of plates and cutlery into student rooms can be chalked up to a combination of laziness and the &#8220;everyone is else is doing it&#8221; phenomenon. When I was in college, our dining services would hold &#8220;amnesty&#8221; periods for borrowed dishes: for a week near the end of the semester, students could return plates and silverware without penalty. Dining services staff went door to door in the dorms and asked students to hand over their dishes on the spot. (I don&#8217;t think there was actually any penalty, so &#8216;amnesty&#8217; might not be the right term - but people were definitely more inclined to return the serving ware when they were confronted individually.)</p>\n<p>I realize this solution would require a lot of staff time and effort. How about a compromise - periodically placing buckets in the residential hallways at 15 West for students to return dishes? People&#8217;s sense of responsibility - to the environment and to the RISD community - might trump the lazy factor. That convenience, coupled with posters about the green benefits of reusing washable serving ware, could help to turn the tide.\n</p><p/></div>",

It could not possibly be that hard to buy a plate?! And for the past 2 weeks there have been buckets with signs pleading for the return of plates, and I have seen barely a dozen pieces returned, and full of food? Students couldn&#8217;t even have the courtesy to scrap off their plates? I do not understand the laziness of students here in manners not to do with their studio work. </p>\n<p>I also liked Jeremy&#8217;s idea of having some manner of monetary penalty if the plates are not returned, but as a 5th year who is meal plan-independent I would not want to be held accountable for the misbehavior of other residents. </p>\n<p>As a student concerned with the environmental impact and waste of this school I do find it extremely disheartening that others cannot put their money where there mouth is, in that they could be so short sighted as to steal plates form the portfolio forcing them to use disposable products instead. The same goes for buying palates of bottled water in a vein attempt to spend their meal points every week. Due to this phenomenon the Met has not been able to reduce the number of palates they carry due to customer demand. How can we pretend to care about the bottled water epidemic and then turn around any buy them constantly? I think students really need to be educated about the impact of their short sighted impulses, and need to understand that if they are going to be respected as adults then they need to prove that they can act accordingly. </p>\n<p>That kind of education also coincides nicely with the discussion that Xin Xin brought up about vandalism and general slovenly tendencies for the workrooms and housing on campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

On many of my visits to these areas I have found forks, knifes, spoons, plates and cups left on the patio outside the Met and on work tables and in the trash containers in workrooms and in other places.  Sometimes while on these tours I&#8217;ll take a camera to photograph both the good and bad environment and safety situations I encounter.  On more than one occasion I have sent photos to Dining Services of dinnerware that was just left wherever the person using it had finished with it.  Following up on the forwarded photos, I have discussed solutions to this waste of resources with the staff in Dining.  Based on those discussions I have come to the conclusion that people that leave these dining supplies everywhere or even worse throw them into the trash are totally disrespectful of RISD property.  These actions are indicative of people that either don&#8217;t care or feel entitled to do as they please without regard for the common good of all.  Using my experiences in EHS issues I guesstimate that 30% of a population knows what to do and they do it well, 50% have somewhat of an idea of what to do and do it to the best of their ability, but 20% of the population will do whatever they want without regard for &#8220;the common good&#8221;.  Unfortunately, because of that 20% of the population I have to agree with Jeremy and suggest charging 100% of the population a flat fee to cover the loss.  I believe this is not fair to those that do and/or try to do the right thing.  But I guess that if RISD is just a microcosm of society it has always been those that do the right stuff have to pay for those that don&#8217;t or won&#8217;t.  Maybe a long term solution to the problem is to charge a monetary deposit on the items that is given back when the items are returned &#8211; economic disincentive to being wasteful.  However, this will be really hard to implement, costly to administer and really a waste of resources but maybe one way to get those that won&#8217;t do the right thing to do it!\n</p><p/></div>",

Each resident gets a card at the register and when a  setup is taken out of the dining center the card is punched. When it is returned, it is punched  as returned. When the three punches  out and in are filled, one gets another card. I only suggest three punches out and in, as that would be  sufficient for  three meals, one day. Now this is where it gets sweet, &#8220;Freudian, for today&#8217;s discussion&#8221;.  If a patron/student looses, steels, misplaces, or breaks a  setup and can not return one, they  have to steel one from someone else and return it as theirs before they can get a new card. Now the problem will become a shared/learned experience, but Tim, you get your setups back. And no one is charged. (especially the innocent, if there are any).

The loan amount beyond tuition and fees is refunded to us, and in the case of many students, is used for studio materials (very expensive), rent, food etc. There is a gap, however, between when the semester starts and when refunds are issued that leaves many of us flapping in the wind while we wait for the money we have borrowed to use for our education, and watch part of our semester tick away in futility.</p>\n<p>Federal laws prohibit loans from being dispersed ahead of their arrival (logical), but the system once they arrive leaves something to be desired. Refunds are issued either 1 or 2 weeks after the semester starts because of a policy that checks are cut but once a week. In the case of this semester, school starts on the 16th and checks will be cut either on the 20th or the 27th. This leaves a potential gap of 11 very important days at the beginning of ones semester without an oar to paddle. 11 days may not seem like a lot but consider that its the equivalent of 10% of the semester. In tuition dollars (roughly $13,000 a semester) this means that an investment of $1,300 is significantly compromised.</p>\n<p>I believe that it is more than worth the cost of these hefty loans to be here. RISD is a fantastic education. I would like to suggest that we remedy problems like this in the spirit of making it better. I hate imagining that like me, there are students &#8220;waiting around&#8221; for loan refunds while their educational opportunities pass by. I would suggest more aggressive refund check issuing during these periods (beginning of Spring and beginning of Fall). Thanks for any feedback!</p></div>",

Let me also be clear that I am referring to non-Hollywood DVDs that I use for my classes.</p>\n<p>The easy solution to this has in fact crossed my mind: just return the darn movies on time or renew them online. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time though, especially hard-working, time-strapped RISD students and we deserve better than to be slapped with $15 in fees for keeping three DVDs an extra day, whatever the reason.</p>\n<p>I would like to point to Media Resources&#8217; lending policy as a suggestion for compromise, which loans far more coveted and valuable items than DVDs. If you return items late twice you&#8217;ve lost your borrowing privileges for the semester, end of story. Pretty harsh, but at least I can still afford to eat.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts or comments on making this happen?</p>\n<p>Mike</p></div>",

The collection had been built entirely by faculty request in support of the curriculum, so we needed to be sure items would be available when needed for classes. </p>\n<p>The fines and circulation policies were set in discussion with the Library Committee with the primary motivation being to get the stuff back in a reasonable amount of time. The Committee reviewed the policy after the first year, and reconfirmed the fines, making some changes in the policy for faculty use. I will be happy to bring the discussion up again with your suggestions in mind. Remember that we do have a drop box for videos and DVDs and the library staff is pretty accommodating if you just communicate with us, so don&#8217;t hesitate to call. 709-5901.</p>\n<p>Carol Terry<br/>\nDirector of Library Services\n</p><p/></div>",

Also, most of the people I know who check out DVD&#8217;s live in 15 west. I myself have never understood how people can excuse lateness when returning something that is on their way out every morning.</p>\n<p>I myself am glad that the library has so many DVD&#8217;s for us to watch. The athenaeum dose not let RSID students check out DVD&#8217;s unless a fee is paid. Also, I don&#8217;t think video fines are a thing of the 90&#8217;s.

I don&#8217;t want to wait and wait for someone to decide to return them.  And a $5 dollar fee is a great incentive, especially if you are watching materials for a class that other people may need or want to watch as well.  The library is open Mon-Thurs 8:30am-11 pm and also has drop boxes for books and videos just outside the security desk at 15 West.  Also the DVDs that the library does own, and lend, are not equal to a blockbuster video.  I think it you would have a hard time trying to find 75% of what the library has at Blockbuster.  And that is because they are expensive, a lot more than 15.99 for your blockbuster hit at Target.  Non-Hollywood means they are not mainstream, which means they are expensive.  They have lots of materials that are hard to come by.   So they need to protect and ensure that things are returned so that other patrons can use the materials.  </p>\n<p>Also the fees are  not dubious.  When you apply for the library card freshman year, you sign that you are aware of all the rules and fines.  All the videos also have stickers on them, warning you that the fee is $5 a day after 3 days. </p>\n<p>The library is not out to get anyone, as I have often heard.  The fees that everyone pays go to purchasing more materials for everyone to use.  I feel quite lucky that we can check out as many things as we can, considering how rare and expensive a lot of the materials are.</p>\n<p>If the library were to start this policy where, after 2 late returns, you were revoked of your right to check out DVD&#8217;s, then someone in Michael&#8217;s position would only have one chance left.  And one day perhaps you are busy again, and you accidentally turn it in late.  Then you are out of luck.  This to me seems much more exorbitant than a fee.  If we were perfect people, we would never turn anything in late.  I think Media Resources policy makes sense for them exactly for the reasons mentioned above, they are much more expensive items, but this is not a solution for the library, which is here to be available for all the students.</p>\n<p>I think a $5 fee is not unreasonable.  If you don;t want to pay the fee, don&#8217;t be late.  And if you aren&#8217;t sure you can remember, don&#8217;t check it out, just watch it in the library.\n</p><p/></div>",

In retrospect I guess I was sort of comparing apples in oranges to make a point.</p>\n<p>Carol, knowing the library&#8217;s background is certainly helpful and puts the DVD lending policy more into perspective.  I&#8217;ve never questioned the value of RISD&#8217;s library and unreservedly appreciate all the work you and all staff do to keep these wonderful resources at our disposal.  I especially appreciate your thoughtful response.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to raise the dialogue because I don&#8217;t agree with the policy.  I respect that there are folks who don&#8217;t agree with me and that maybe my viewpoint is short-sighted.  My general observation is that those students who do get these fines are not happy and the polite staff are put into a difficult position defending them.  My hope was that by raising the issue maybe all parties could benefit from a reconsideration of pricing, especially if using a lesser fine or different approach hasn&#8217;t been tried since they were first set into circulation.  Would it be fair to suggest maybe a minimal fee for the first late return of a DVD during a given semester, having it increase to $5 after that?  By doing so we would give students one chance to get it right while also giving the library more recourse when questioned.  If you were to mention this issue to the Library Committee that would be more than I could ever ask for (even if its voted down unanimously!)</p>\n<p>Best,<br/>\nMike\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;ve noted since my arrival on campus that there are none of the usual big displays to push information out to the campus. It&#8217;s pretty hard to get a word out there. And some of those big displays at colleges can look awfully boring. In my basic research here at RISD, it appears that the idea of dynamic signage on campus has been around but never been prioritized. RISD should have the best (or at least the most innovative) display system around. </p>\n<p>No fear RISD. By the time fall term rolls around we&#8217;ll hopefully be pushing forward a small-scale <i>experimental</i> network of displays to get info off of the many blogs and discussion portals at RISD into public eyeball spaces. The concept is for it to be community-owned and operated. I pulled a few favors to get the costs down for this kind of technology deployment and will also be personally investing in the project to get it going. Stay tuned and keep on dreaming.</p></div>",

I imagine that I will be adding bibliographies, my weblists, interesting links, as well as my project briefs, images, etc: pretty much everything I have researched in preparation for my classes will appear on the pages of these blogs. People teaching in classes in other institutions are free to use these links/ideas/information. That&#8217;s good, right? I know some faculty copyright their syllabi and project descriptions because it can be frustrating to work so hard on designing and developing project briefs and criteria, only to find that someone somewhere else has &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the project description and is attempting to teach it in a different, possibly less considered, way. Also grad students occasionally move on to teaching straight out of grad school and they too will often use projects that derive straight from the ones they were given while in school. I don&#8217;t feel strongly about this one way or the other, but I am curious about what others think. What is the feeling about this in the RISD community? (is there already a thread about this?) The web has of course totally altered the feeling of community property out there, and I know that sharing is the new paradigm. And I am all for sharing (I think). Are you?</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I&#8217;m all for sharing too, Lucy.  It&#8217;s the nature of scholarship.  Citation is key.  Scholars build on knowledge assembled by others, and on their insights.  It&#8217;s a web in itself.  I think art works similarly.  </p>\n<p>I am indebted to syllabi I have found online.  There is such a wealth of information, intelligence becomes defined by selection.  Like many grad students, I too brought into the classroom what I had learned from my teachers, or what I considered best practice.  When I look back on their syllabi (not that long ago, I was at grad school 1994-2001), they seem amazingly sparse and unarticulated to me.  Certainly my own undergraduate syllabi are much more articulated (not necessarily a great thing and something I&#8217;m in the process of changing).  </p>\n<p>So, on a concrete level, I have borrowed often from syllabi and information online; I&#8217;ve participated in online poetics/pedagogy/poetry discussions for 15 years, I&#8217;ve posted my syllabi in online venues, and emailed them to anyone who asked.  As you say, the environment has changed completely.  Now we can participate in a communal building of knowledge, and material which was inaccessible is no longer so.  </p>\n<p>My own field of poetry has very little at stake financially: there are no huge profits to be made.  Even if I have a very, very good idea, I probably think I have more to gain by sharing than by harboring.  I have gained immeasurably from the ideas of others and in my own work, a peculiar law seems to ordain that if I have an idea, work with it, and publish it, more ideas will come; whereas if I don&#8217;t act, ideas slow down.  It&#8217;s all about dialogue, of a kind.  Even to publish implies a sort of confidence in the audience.  The worst thing that can happen, for me, is to lose confidence in the audience and to turn away from publishing.  But that&#8217;s another story.  </p>\n<p>The main part of my response is: give away and take what you can, always acknowledging your sources.  That said, institutions won&#8217;t necessarily feel likewise, and may feel they own student or faculty work.  For me, though, one of the huge benefits to living at this particular time is the free availability of information.  As a writer, I&#8217;m always for free exchange.  Kenneth Goldsmith&#8217;s /ubu Editions, with which I have a book, is a good model for me.  His motto: Please steal our books.<br/>\nBut writing, particularly poetry, is a special case, with its own economy, which I&#8217;m glad of now that the prevailing economy has proved irrational.\n</p><p/></div>",

In general, I&#8217;m sympathetic with opening up participation and exchange in scholarship; let&#8217;s solve problems rather than own them, contribute to understanding rather than divide it up. Sounds great! However, part of the reason that academic study and teaching emphasizes individual ownership of topics (&#8220;What is the area of _your_ research?&#8221; ) is because that&#8217;s really the only meaningful capital people have in current systems of hiring and promotion. I think things will change only when there is wider recognition, especially in professional evaluation, of dialogic and social approaches to creativity, teaching, and research.\n</p><p/></div>",

In the arts, I think it used to be called &#8220;apprenticeship&#8221; and the result was an ever-increasing and refined corpus of knowledge and technique that can barely be scratched by today&#8217;s colleges, at least in the case of those fields that have such a history. On the other hand, the apprenticeship system placed a great emphasis on the pedigree of learning ( &#8220;Van Dyck, student of Rubens&#8221;), thereby intrinsically protecting the title to ideas, if not the &#8220;ownership&#8221; in the strict sense.</p>\n<p>Syllabi are sort of the DNA of academic work, at least in the fine arts and, I suspect, in design.

        "content": "<div><p>Steve the Lawyer here, with a few points of clarification and (I hope) reassurance about the subject of syllabi and copyright:</p>\n<p>1.  Your syllabi <i>are</i> copyrighted, automatically by operation of law, at the moment you create them.  You don&#8217;t have to register them with the Copyright Office or even mark them with a &#8220;&#169;&#8221; in order to &#8220;copyright&#8221; them (though it will help you to <i>enforce</i> your copyright if you do so).  In other words, in the words of the bumper sticker, &#8220;copyright happens&#8221; . . . .</p>\n<p>2.  Under RISD&#8217;s <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/pdfs/IPP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Policy on Ownership and Use of Intellectual Property Rights</a>, faculty own the copyright to their syllabi (and other scholarly and artistic work), subject only to some limited use rights on the part of RISD.</p>\n<p>3.  Which means that if others use your syllabi without your permission, they may well be infringing your copyright.  Keep in mind, however, that copyright protects only the document itself, <i>not</i> the ideas underlying it.  As far as copyright is concerned, anyone is free, for example, to teach a course on the social history of American women, using primary source material as the main &#8220;text&#8221; (a great course I took in college long ago) - and even to follow a similar structure and use essentially the same material for the course.  Under the fair use doctrine, it would even be legal to use portions of the original syllabus for that course.  (Just how much would depend on the facts and circumstances.)  The only thing that copyright would prohibit is a more wholesale use of the document itself.</p>\n<p>4.  In addition to copyright, academic misconduct policies also apply.  In our context, the use of someone else&#8217;s syllabus, <i>portions</i> of someone else&#8217;s syllabus, or even just the <i>ideas</i> underlying the syllabus without appropriate citation would constitute plagiarism.  You can&#8217;t sue someone for plagiarizing your work, but you can institute an academic misconduct proceeding.  And remember that, while appropriately crediting the source will keep you out of plagiarism trouble, it is not a defense to copyright infringement.</p>\n<p>5.  None of this is to suggest that you <i>should</i> be restrictive about the use of your syllabi.  It&#8217;s nice to share.  You don&#8217;t have to enforce your copyright even if someone infringes on it, and, if you like, you can even grant prospective permission to use your syllabi in designated ways by, for example, posting them with a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/license\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons license</a>.  Collaboration is part of the academic enterprise, and building on the work of others is how we advance.\n</p><p/></div>",

Melissa, the first poster to this thread, and likely others, wants a few longer weekends for &#8220;rest&#8221;. But what if there is lots of homework to do on those weekends. That may not be restful to some.  Others don&#8217;t want longer weekends, perhaps because that would extend the term and they prefer more break time at the end of a semester, to be home early, get a job and so forth.  It&#8217;s choices and tradeoffs. </p>\n<p>Here in  brief, but necessarily not fully complete, is information on how the calendar is put together. Issues of concern to students are always carefully considered in the deliberations on the calendar. </p>\n<p>RISD&#8217;s academic calendar goes through a creation and review process that involves several offices: Registrar, Residence Life, Human Resources, and Continuing Education. It is then reviewed and vetted by the Deans Advisory Council and the Provost.  There used to be an ad hoc Calendar Committee which included faculty, but that was disbanded years ago at the request of the Faculty Meeting when it issued a report on restructuring and streamlining committees campus-wide and they felt the calendar creation process was sufficiently robust. </p>\n<p>In addition to concerns for faculty and students, the calendar is put together with many guidelines and campus operations taken into account. The most basic and most important is to provide the proper amount of time for instruction. The calendar is made up of two semesters, Fall and Spring. Each is twelve weeks long followed by a week set aside for exams and crits. We also have a mandatory six week Wintersession. There are contractual items regarding when faculty return after summer, and when they leave after Spring, and breaks in between. So that students and parents can plan well in advance, we adopted a set date for Commencement as the first Saturday after Memorial Day. </p>\n<p>Other items are considered as well. We always make our Spring break match the Spring break at Brown. We always have a break during the Fall at Thanksgiving that runs from Wednesday through Sunday. We start the Fall term on a Wednesday during the week following Labor Day (see, we do celebrate national holidays!) for all sorts of logistical reasons  involving campus housing, weekend move-ins and move-outs, hotel availability, new student orientation, convocation and many others. Wintersession always begins after the new calendar year, never before. </p>\n<p>I am happy to meet with students who would like to further discuss the academic calendar.</p>\n<p>Steve Berenback<br/>\nRegistrar\n</p><p/></div>",

Even with a week-long break between WS and Spring, RISD&#8217;s calendar is among the more pernicious among US colleges, and spring break is always way too late, regarding the &#8220;19-week semester,&#8221; and comes too early in the arc of the spring.  </p>\n<p>I hope we won&#8217;t automatically adopt this year&#8217;s calendar again when 2015 squeezes us into similar circumstances.

Maybe it would be worth experimenting with a more typical calendar of two 15-week semesters in order to avoid this kind of pile up, or adopt a quarter system (slightly longer WS and slightly shorter Fall and Spring terms) for the year rather than the hybrid semester/quarter arrangement that W&#8217;session is.

One of the past objections raised with regard to Wintersession was that the course content of an &#8220;intense&#8221; 6-week Wintersession is not the same as the content possible during a 12-week semester (in Liberal Arts classes, for instance, you can&#8217;t physically read the same amount of books or write papers with the same depth), and therefore you can&#8217;t really give Wintersession courses equal credit as semester courses in fulfilling the educational requirements of a degree. That claim was recently refuted by a reinvigoration of the original spirit of Wintersession courses as experimental; they are not meant to be &#8220;compacted&#8221; versions of semester courses but rather a different species of course altogether. Interestingly, that refutation revealed the extent to which any link between course credits and course content was illusory. Course content is, in fact, malleable: faculty define courses offered and the learning they promote, making them introductory, advanced, &#8220;experimental,&#8221; etc. Course credit, however, is determined by something more rigid: total contact hours. For x contact hours you earn x course credits, and depending on how many courses you take, you earn x credits toward a degree and graduation. </p>\n<p>Contact hours is also the prime determinant in the length of RISD&#8217;s semesters and breaks. As Steve explained, there are certain benchmark parameters (after Labor Day, Memorial Day, summer break, etc.), that define the time period into which contact hours must be fit. But beyond that, as Mark suggests, there is the potential to shape things differently. If you only need 36 contact hours to make a course, then why not make Wintersession a three-day, round-the-clock, &#8220;super-intense&#8221; experience and create a longer break in January and February? Wouldn&#8217;t that meet the criterion of required contact hours just as much as drawing it out over 6 weeks? Of course, I&#8217;m being facetious, but seriously: what prevents us from instituting that equally experimental framework? In other words, what is it that makes a course legitimate and worth three credits beyond total contact hours? And how would an answer to that question enable us to see the academic calendar in a new light?\n</p><p/></div>",

And I understand that missing a Monday class may not be beneficial to that specific course.  But at other colleges and universities, they recognize national holidays, even if it means missing one class for a week- and faculty are aware and prepare around it.  </p>\n<p>I feel that the mentality at RISD could be lightened greatly by simply recognizing one or two more Monday holidays (during the academic school year).  I think these would be great days to offer a multitude of opportunities outside of the classroom and off of the RISD campus.  There are many more people who cannot go home or leave campus for those long weekends, than those who can.  It would also allow for our campus to expand community service days to one per semester, whereas the formal community service day is usually on MLK day (usually organized by students and OSL/ResLife).</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think we should look at these Monday holidays negatively, as they could be used very productively for the majority of the RISD community.  They could also promote RISD in a more positive light within Providence.  And as for relaxation, stress is a very common theme at RISD, and who says that a simple and occasional holiday couldn&#8217;t lighten the mood and promote a different mindset?  Being conscious of the holidays, and the fact that we&#8217;re still trudging through this/that Monday is not necessarily an effective way to build and promote positive attitudes around campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

I have often been able to experiment with form in my weaving and changing fabric classes, having created several large sculptures.  I have additionally been able to continue screenprinting, something I really enjoyed doing in high school.

I highly recommend attending the senior shows in Woods-Gerry, and also final crits within the departments.  Seeing the work and experiencing the crits can be a great guide for you.\n</p><p/></div>",

Many of our graduate students and faculty are in disciplines that are informed by in their UG major but no longer that. One&#8217;s career is a composition, not a solid chunk of something. It is a good idea to major in something anchored in your values, natural abilities and interests, and to then add in the variations as one would add seasonings.

It&#8217;s one of those majors that nearly no one declares on their application to risd because no one knows it&#8217;s even an option.

For many things in life.<br/>\nWhen I decided going back to school, I knew I wanted to draw, but there were many areas where I could apply my drawing skills.

All these activities, made me realize that despite the challenges ahead, Graphic Design would give me the structure I was looking for and the possibility of exploring a broad spectrum of ways to communicate.<br/>\nDrawing has become part of my language, which I identify as a strength, but all I have learned in the GD department has helped me explore new venues and ways of processing information.</p>\n<p>I would say, based on my experience, it was more important for me to choose that area that I was extremely curious about, than an area I was particularly good at.

I believe as my friend did with his wife -and I won&#180;t tell him I just compared his wife with my major- I have chosen a space where I can have a longstanding conversation that so far, has never been dull.

We spent a night in the cabin at Lightning Field, without lighting. There is never lightning, because the metal rods at the same height create a field, not points, in the desert. Lightning strikes points, and not fields. It is an instrument for measuring a sublime landscape, but by virtue of its measured precision, it points only to the sublime as not measurable. It speaks to the problem of too much.</p>\n<p>The Very Large Array telescope is on a plateau elsewhere in New Mexico. It is a giant radio telescope covering acres on train tracks, absorbing endless amounts of information from outer space. So much information, in fact, that even if all of humanity were to live for eternity, all the incoming signals could never be &#8220;seen.&#8221; But by virtue of endless gathering, to scientific ends, it can never acknowledge the problem of too much, because measure and hierarchy cannot be thought at the same time as the democratic, content-neutral gathering of information that the VLA telescopes is built to accomplish.</p>\n<p>So:<br/>\nWhat I miss at RISD is not the ideas and desires, but rather a cogent way of acknowledging that those are infinite. Are we Lighting Field or Very Large Array? Are we gathering information under the postulate of neutrality and non-hierarchical study? Or are we working empirically, towards as set of provisional conclusions as a way of reducing the number of variables, aiming towards an outcome, contextualizing our thinking - and (something critical theory did at least a hundred years ago) recognizing the belief in value-neutral information gathering as its own particular blind spot?</p></div>",

The Office of Information Technology (OIT) has been helping us to test it and we feel it&#8217;s ready to be released for general use.</p>\n<p>Please note that it should NOT be installed on any computer with dual displays and it is only for Intel-based Macs only. This screensaver also requires access to the Internet to pull the data from the RISD intranet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/downloads/RISDScreenSaver_v6.zip\">This file contains the Screensaver application and the instructions text</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone for making the sign a success by populating it with event information, messages and images that we all benefit from.</p>\n<p>Eric Meier, Director of Interactive Media<br/>\nMedia + Partners, RISD</p></div>",

It has been improved a lot over the last months, but it&#8217;s still a beta/work-in-progress application, so some bugs are bound to surface. We do report the bugs to Potion, who fix them as they can. Media + Partners does not own the source code for this application.</p>\n<p>2. Potion disabled the script in the screensaver version and people can&#8217;t be identified, per Kirk&#8217;s question</p>\n<p>3. In the interim, users who are experiencing System Preference crashes should try the following:</p>\n<p>    a. Search for a file called &#8220;com.apple.systempreferences.plist&#8221; in your home folder: MacintoshHD/Users/(your home folder)/Library/Preferences. Move it out of the Preferences folder and onto your desktop temporarily.<br/>\n    b. Next, uninstall your current RISD screensaver file. Go to MacintoshHD/Library/Screen Savers on your hard drive. Note that this is the ROOT-LEVEL Library folder on the Hard Drive, not the Library folder within your home folder. Move the RisdScreenSaver.saver file to the trash and empty your trash.<br/>\n    c. Reboot the computer<br/>\n    d. Re-download the screensaver zip, unzip the files, and manually place the RisdScreenSaver.saver file into MacintoshHD/Library/Screen Savers. Again, this is the ROOT-LEVEL Library folder on the Hard Drive, not the Library folder within your home folder.<br/>\n    e. Reopen System Preferences to choose and activate the RISD screensaver. Let us know if System Preference crashes still occur.<br/>\n    NOTE: Because you moved the .plist file that corresponds to System Preferences, you will likely have to reset some preferences. If, for any reason, you wish to go back to your previous System Preference settings, just restore the file called &#8220;com.apple.systempreferences.plist&#8221; that you placed on your desktop. It can be restored by moving it back into MacintoshHD/Users/(your user folder)/Library/Preferences. You will be prompted that a &#8220;newer&#8221; version of the file exists here. Just save the old file over it and reboot.</p>\n<p>One last thing&#8230; if the screensaver DID crash your machine and you still have it installed - can you please .zip it up and send it to me? Potion will be able to more thoroughly troubleshoot the problem with an actual bad file. </p>\n<p>Thanks for your help in this.</p>\n<p>-e meier\n</p><p/></div>",

I am a RISD Staff member who would like to see RISD save in places where it will mean the most. I am fearful, as are many others staffers I have spoken with over the course of the past month. Loss of employment is the utmost fear in the hearts of many, but coupled with that fear is the unrelenting waste seen on campus, as well as the continued spending from places such as the museum.</p>\n<p>While we are all in total understanding of a museum needing to provide new displays for those who wish to peruse their halls, there remains a gross lack of funds with which the college is operating. The museum has, in its collections and cases, artifacts, items and baubles that have not been seen in the museum hallways in years. Why are we paying for climate controlled, dry, damp, cool, warm housing for the artifacts? Why do we not revolve our museum inventory in an effort to have the museum actually show an operational &#8220;break-even&#8221;? The museum has run over budget as many years as I have been employed at RISD. If we are going to purchase and display new and wonderful procured art, shouldn&#8217;t we sell / share what has not seen the light of day in literally years?</p>\n<p>Why are departments on campus allowed to claim space that is now not being used efficiently? Why are we not utilizing 10 Westminster St. when we are still paying the lease? Where has the brainstorming gone?</p>\n<p>I used the museum as an example - not a target; I voiced questions that have been posed to me along with questions of my own. I prefer nitty-gritty to smoke and mirrors and hope that the hard questions finally get asked before jobs are put on the line.</p>\n<p>Any higher education institution must have a system of checks and balances - I see few out of many making good choices to help RISD. However, in the same moment, I can see those who feel as though RISD should be operating as it did 10 years ago and are unwilling to budge from their belief - or raise a finger to help in the current crisis.</p></div>",

I believe John has already addressed the obvious ethical questions this raises, which are numerous. But selling artworks is also impractical. As John and Arnie expressed in the financial meeting, we need to make long-term changes that will result in a permanently sustainable budget given the changing endowment. How would selling artworks aid that? It&#8217;s just a thumb in the dike. Furthermore, many of the objects in storage at the Museum have great educational, or scholarly, or cultural value but less monetary value than you might expect, especially in today&#8217;s market. Selling artworks is a short-term solution that could only lead to regret. </p>\n<p>Conceptions of value change (just think how fast the value of a home has changed since last February); so we need to be extremely careful of making snap decisions about what does or does not have value as we make these difficult decisions. Just because we have art, does that mean we should sell it? We need to try to weather trends, see through the panic, and preserve these things for the future.</p>\n<p>And since, as John stated, our guiding principle is our educational mission, I would also argue that these objects play a very important role in that mission (and that&#8217;s what our founders believed, as well).\n</p><p/></div>",

(Liz, I think we should upgrade the anonymous filter so people who do not want to reveal their identities can choose their own handles - Pinky-and-the-Brain or MuseDir, for example.) The mission of the school is teaching students. While a museum can play a role in that mission, it is fundamentally an adjunct to it. I would argue that the instructional budget is much more central to the mission of the institution, and that is where we are talking of making the biggest cuts. Basically RISD has too much stuff, and it is choking the institutional mission. We can point fingers (Unsecured loans to administrators, anyone?) but ultimately that is not particularly helpful - though it can feel damn good. </p>\n<p>I suggest that we sell $20 million of assets to cover this unprecedented financial mess we are in. Since real estate is not going to sell, that probably means the museum will have to donate some of its collection to ensure that the faculty and staff remain intact. The sale of those objects will buy us the time to sit down as a community and really set priorities, which we would have been focusing on if the financial crisis had not hit. If the economy continues to degrade next year, we&#8217;ve bought some time. We also do not have to touch benefits. RISD is the people, not the artwork. We can always make more art, but losing a teacher to give insight into a piece of art, why it was made, how it was made, even if, gasp, they have to use a projection to show that piece of art to the students should be unacceptable at the best art and design school in the nation.\n</p><p/></div>",

I am very disappointed that job loss and benefits loss are the most radical strategies being presented to address current challenges.  Arney says some expenses are fixed or escalating and can&#8217;t be negotiated.  You can&#8217;t not pay the interest on RISD&#8217;s borrowing (though you can acknowledge that borrowing preceded the current economic crisis).  You can&#8217;t not pay the utilities bills.  But you can get rid of people, compromise their livelihood: because of their humanity, you might even get them to agree, and contribute to a scholarship on their way out.  </p>\n<p>On the income side, not only can you not sell art, you can&#8217;t even speak about it.  What sort of educational environment is that?  </p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on our imagination, ideas, appetite for the future, ability to conceptualize.  Can we come up with anything more imaginative in this crisis but extreme belt-tightening, job loss, and benefits loss?</p>\n<p>I have no experience in finance beyond my continued survival, sketchy though it is.  In a crisis, if I had savings the value of which were plummeting (endowment) and debt (approved by the Trustees) which was escalating, and the annual interest related to both was coming closer and closer in value, I would pay off the debt and start over.  I&#8217;m sure there are sound and compelling reasons why we can&#8217;t pay off our debt with the endowment, or sell anything from the museum, or open a restaurant in the museum, or completely do without electricity one day a week, or even have an imaginative idea other than the very stereotypical one of job loss.  But if we can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t believe we can truly say we are innovative.</p>\n<p>What does One RISD mean if members of our community lose their jobs?  Are people expendable?  I think they are our most precious asset.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been here 7 years and it&#8217;s interesting to see the changing profile of the endowment, the health of which has never been presented as good (until yesterday).  In the years when the endowment was doing well, we were not given the impression it was doing well, it was always a question of tightening the belt and maybe in two or three more years we may be in a position to breathe.  Since I&#8217;ve been here it has been emphasized that the endowment was a relatively small part of our financial picture, that we are largely tuition dependent.  We still are.  Students are keeping this school going.  And I have to agree with Jonathan most heartily: our mission is the educational program.</p>\n<p>This blog is a valuable forum but it&#8217;s not where decisions are made.  Would it be radical to say that decision-making should include those for whom a 0% salary increase would mean real hardship?  0% salary increase across the school sounds egalitarian but it&#8217;s not.  </p>\n<p>I appreciate everything John is doing to open up communication.  It is still meaningful to me to be able to say I disagree.  I don&#8217;t believe RISD is a separate entity from the people who live and work here, though it is an institution organized around renewal, i.e., students who graduate, bring RISD into the world, and the world back to RISD.\n</p><p/></div>",

By the way, such loans are not uncommon in higher-ed in recruiting packages and the recipients should in no way be faulted. And the two employees that are the only cases I know of with such loans stood up *openly* in front of the community and explained their respective situation. As I said in this morning&#8217;s meeting, if there are other such loans out there that I am unaware of please let me know as aren&#8217;t to my knowledge. Going forward, I can say that under my watch there will be no such loans offered in any recruiting packages. I hope comments on this matter are now closed and we can move to other points of discussion. </p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t President Obama&#8217;s speech this evening such a pleasure to watch? He, and our entire nation, needs our collective help to pick ourselves up. It&#8217;s inspiring to see a president that cares so much about education &#8212; the very stuff that we do here at RISD.</p>\n<p>I will respond to many of the other issues raised in this strand this week (i.e. one-ness, sellilng art/assets, fairness, and so forth), and as we move forward.

I don&#8217;t recall where I first heard it but do recall someone saying that human resources were the most valuable asset of any entity.

Walking into the building each morning feels like coming home and the students/faculty/staff here are like family. It took a while but somehow you begin to come to terms with saying goodbye to students as they graduate and move on in life. You take comfort knowing your &#8216;newborn&#8217; will be arriving in a few months when the fall semester begins. But perhaps we&#8217;re not a family at all. Maybe we&#8217;re simply electrons that are bonded and shed as conditions change. That feels cold. It certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like the RISD I&#8217;ve grown to love.</p>\n<p>The thought of losing my income hurts but the thought of losing a family member (or my privilege to be part of the family) hurts a lot more.

As my favorite philosopher writes, &#8220;In this bright future you can&#8217;t forget your past,&#8221; and I think it is crucial to recognize that RISD got sucked into the ethos of corporate entitlement and overspending like all of corporate America, and in so doing, lost sight of the mission of the college. I think we all recognize that this financial irresponsibility was not the fault of anyone who is at RISD now, but you also have to recognize that the faculty&#8217;s and staff&#8217;s ideas did not shape the spending patterns of your predecessors. In fact, most times, we were left completely out of financial decisions. And yet, it is the faculty and staff who are being told that they will have to sacrifice. As David indicates in his beautifully worded post, many of us have given our working lives to this institution for much longer than anyone on your senior staff. If this is a new era at the institution, then it should not begin with layoffs and cutbacks that impact the people who have remained true to its mission. </p>\n<p>And, please, call me Jonathan.\n</p><p/></div>",

Because there is still a lot of work to do, that $5 million gap was left pretty vague.  As a member of the senior management team, I can say that we wanted to be clear that layoffs are likely &#8212; this is the same issue that every school is grappling with, and it would be disingenuous to say it was not likely.  But reducing staff is not the approach or desired outcome by any means. </p>\n<p>I thought it might be helpful to give you a sense of how I&#8217;ve approached the Institutional Engagement staff and budget.  I knew when I was hired last spring that I needed to rebuild the staff &#8212; more than a third of the positions were open.  I was offered the possibility of hiring a search firm and getting to work hiring the positions as defined.  But that didn&#8217;t make sense to me for a couple reasons.  For one,  because the demand for experienced fundraising staff far exceeds the supply, I think headhunters in general find people who change jobs frequently, and primarily for more money.  That&#8217;s not what I was looking for.  Secondly, I knew I needed to rethink what RISD needed.  So I&#8217;ve hired slowly, and carefully &#8212; finding people who are generally changing salaries with only modest increases (or less)  because they want to be part of the mission of RISD and work with in this open environment that John has created.  As I&#8217;ve hired, I&#8217;ve looked for people who can not only do their jobs, but can do more &#8212; bringing additional skills that will allow us to be more adaptable and more successful at raising money.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not filling all the open positions.  I&#8217;m not rehiring an Associate Vice President &#8212; and that significant salary savings goes in the attrition savings column.  We&#8217;re not hiring a coordinator for the development research team &#8212; we&#8217;ll use students and supply needed work-study to them instead.  We&#8217;ve hired a terrific new Asst. Director of Corporate, Foundation, and Government relations because we think she can help us greatly increase government support and recover some of her salary at the same time.  We&#8217;ve decided to hire a consultant for 20 hours a week for 6 months to provide grant writing support instead of refilling another position &#8212; he&#8217;s currently at Princeton and brings great expertise.  Doing that brings us great talent, but at less cost and does not add a new salary line or benefits.  I promoted Pamela Harrington to director of the Corporate, Foundation and Government Relations team because I recognized that we have some wonderful talent inside RISD, even in a department that was roundly criticized by many on campus.  Pat Brown moved from Communications to work with Chris Hartley and Claire Robinson on special events and alumni relations.  That could have been a layoff for Pat, since her job no longer existed in Media  + Partners, but instead it was a huge gain for IE to get her talents and expertise.  </p>\n<p> It&#8217;s easier for me to make these kinds of changes because there are so many open positions &#8212; but it&#8217;s the kind of approach to thinking differently about the work that we will need to do across the board.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As both a student here at RISD and a human being, I am completely in agreement with Ms. Bohn.  Nearly every single staff member or faculty member here at RISD has made me feel welcome and even appreciated.  Going to away to college can be one of the most difficult pinnacles in one&#8217;s life career.  As a transfer student (which I believe can only make joining a community that much more difficult), I was greeted with open arms.  I have found confidantes in many staff and faculty members.  It would be a downfall to this community to lose anyone.  I believe there is much that can be done to get through this and like many others, I have a few ideas of my own.</p>\n<p>1) Most people are saving their money, not spending it, so selling pieces from the museums collection would not benefit us all that well.  I do however, agree that to cut costs, we should exhibit work that we do have.<br/>\n2) Outside scholarships.  The less money RISD needs to give out, the more it obviously saves.  Coming up with ideas for outside scholarships is a wonderful idea.  Perhaps the Financial Aid office can provide students with more outside resources to seek out?  For example, with the student art sales, perhaps a small percentage of the profits made by students can either be taken out or donated should the student so choose.  Fundraising events sponsored by corporate entities?<br/>\n3) I believe most people would rather take a cut in pay rather than lose their job entirely.  This is something to be heavily considered.<br/>\n4) Technological upgrades, while important, are not necessary.  Having the creme-de-la-creme of technology but no one there to teach it or go to when having a problem makes it virtually useless.<br/>\n5) If there are buildings/space which goes unused, why not turn it into a day care center?  It could bring in money, provide more jobs to others, perhaps even students, and provide faculty and staff with cheaper child care alternatives.<br/>\n6) Truly enforce departmental rules.  Many students who work the facilities let their friends or others &#8220;slip by.&#8221;  Why should students pay for others to be allowed to use their facilities?  It ends up costing the department more money and isn&#8217;t fair to those who major in that department.<br/>\nEnforce late fees!  As much as students may complain, it was their responsibility.  Nothing is learned if tardiness is excused.<br/>\n7) Artist lectures - free for faculty/staff/students, require a fee for those outside?  Or to save money, only have alumni come in for a while, or more often.  While they may also receive a stipend for their time, perhaps only their travel expenses should be covered to pinch pennies.  They should be honored to speak to their future fellow alumni and if this situation was explained to them, they should understand.</p>\n<p>These are only a few of my suggestions and I hope they are a bit helpful.  I cannot stress enough how much appreciate the RISD community in it&#8217;s ENTIRETY and would see it as a great downfall to lose anyone.  This is the time when people need to be more proactive in this community and truly band together so we can prevent losses money-wise, staff/faculty-wise, morale-wise.\n</p><p/></div>",

Are opportunities that we have passed up in the past more appealing now?  For example, when asked for revenue generators I suggested a 9pm to 6am caf&#233; in what is now a studio in the met.

One is &#8220;community,&#8221; the other is &#8220;academy.&#8221;<br/>\nThey are huge concepts but have at times been appropriated to serve limited agendas.<br/>\nBoth terms embody RISD&#8217;s core mission: to be an academy that serves an inclusive community. The members of that community are not only RISD students, alumni, faculty, and staff, but also the public who are educated through our Museum.</p>\n<p>To those who wish to limit community to  our private academic mission, let&#8217;s remember that our founders purposely and intentionally endowed RISD with the responsibility to be a public academy, as well. This is a requirement, not an option. Centered in the Museum&#8217;s collections, staff, and programs, the public mission is fulfilled by making art and art education available to every man, woman, and child who visits the Museum&#8217;s galleries. Like a great public library, the Museum offers intellectual and spiritual resources to all.</p>\n<p>The call to limit the Museum&#8217;s activities and to divest RISD of its collections erroneously intimates that the collections are &#8220;private property,&#8221; when in fact they were established through private donations and endowments in order to serve the public, in keeping with RISD&#8217;s historic mission. We have neither the moral nor legal right to dispose of those collections at will. We are obligated to provide these resources to the brilliant students who have earned a place at RISD&#8217;s private academy, and to share them through our public academy, as a public service, to the extended community. We have succeeded in upholding this broad commitment to the community for more than a century, preserving institutional and personal integrity and honoring that of our founders. </p>\n<p>We all have realistic fears about the consequences of budget cuts at RISD and its impact on our lives. In response, students, staff and faculty have posted positive, creative, generous, and respectful suggestions across campus, and employees have expressed a widespread willingness to accept reduced salaries in order to save positions and sustain programmatic excellence. To those who think this can be accomplished by subverting our mission, or by expending a vital segment of the community, an honest reappraisal is in order. The high road is inclusive and farsighted, and it is a path well taken. We are ALL &#8220;thought-leaders&#8221; at RISD, and we have the ability to forge a solution that preserves our internal community while serving the community at large.</p>\n<p>Maureen O&#8217;Brien\n</p><p/></div>",

For those of you that are unaware, in order to resolve some of Brandeis&#8217; financial issues a decision was made to close their Museum and sell off their art assets. What has happened since the announcement is there are now multiple law suits against Brandeis by the families that entrusted their art as donations to their Museum, and there are numerous condemnations being set forth by external organizations. I came to RISD as a teacher, artist, and designer with no particular strong leanings towards Museums but in my months here I have formulated an opinion based upon my conversations with our campus. </p>\n<p>I believe that selling the art in our Museum would be a terrible thing to do because it sends the message to the world that the work that artists make is simply a commodity to be sold or traded. The art world has been degraded over the past few decades as becoming nothing more than a financial market &#8211; something that has disturbed many artists around the world and especially artists here at RISD. Over and over I have heard RISD artists speak against the &#8220;over-commercialization&#8221; of the &#8220;art industry.&#8221; I feel by selling off art in the Museum, RISD would be simply supporting that industry. </p>\n<p>Secondly as an artist that has artworks in the permanent collections of several Museums like MoMA and so forth, I am unsure of how I feel if MoMA were to sell off my work in order to take care of its financial troubles. Part of me feels bothered (the artist in me that wants to feel their work honored), and part of me feels unbothered (the artist in me that doesn&#8217;t believe that work should be revered). Regarding anything that pertains to myself I have chosen to shed wordly possessions like <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/11/25/free-knowledge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my books;</a> yet I can see that we are all quite different in regards to how we view our art as in <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2194206\" rel=\"nofollow\">this interview</a> I shot in Foundation Studies.</p>\n<p>And after all, questions about selling art are something of a moot point right now because there aren&#8217;t any buyers in the market. I figure in any case that this discussion will continue as it has been ringing in the RISD history for decades, and with this post I log my own opinions on the matter.</p>\n<p>Lastly, regarding the comment above about &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; and Faculty, I suggest we place our thoughts on the Students and why they come to RISD. They come to learn from the Faculty. AND, the Students and Faculty infinitely benefit from being supported by us &#8211; the Staff. We are neither Students nor Faculty, and yet we are vital to the operations of RISD. We at RISD are all necessary components of the grand ecology of RISD. And &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; serve to represent entire divisions and sections. If they are removed, then the entire division/section goes away so such positions are subject to different rules. One would think that job security is better in a higher position, but it is not. In general, &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; face much greater scrutiny than in other positions that are lower in the hierarchy &#8212; in plain words they are more easily terminated for performance as so many people depend upon them for their leadership. For instance, as the highest &#8220;higher-up&#8221; I can be fired by the Board without notice because all of RISD depends upon me to do the right thing, and I would be replaced by someone that the Board would deem as being able to do a better job. In short, &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; are the most expendable of all as they carry the most responsibility. </p>\n<p>Back to my original intent of this post, what I found by traveling the many buildings and floors of our campus today came in three categories:</p>\n<p><b>A. Layoff rumors that were all unfounded:</b></p>\n<p>1/ <i>A rumor that at the two recent campus meetings that John announced 150 layoffs</i>. This is incorrect. I showed a slide on what other colleges are doing. Dartmouth announced 150 layoffs. RISD has not. I repeat. RISD has not.</p>\n<p>2/ <i>Another related rumor that at the two recent campus meetings that John announced 80 layoffs.</i> This is incorrect. At both meetings I did not announce 150, nor did I announce 80 layoffs. </p>\n<p>3/ <i>A rumor that layoffs were happening at the end of March.</i> This is incorrect. &#8220;End of March&#8221; refers to the timeframe by which the Provost&#8217;s short-term working group and the rest of the President&#8217;s Advisory Council&#8217;s units will have the full picture of how we will move forward. </p>\n<p>To be clear, what I said with respect to layoffs was that &#8220;the large budget gap we face will be closed in part through reduction in the number of people by attrition, retirement, and layoffs.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>B. Programmatic closing rumors that were all unfounded:</b></p>\n<p>4/ <i>A rumor that department X is going to close.</i> There was absolutely nothing said to this effect at the two recent campus meetings. I have noted upon my arrival in June that such rumors have been at RISD for decades.</p>\n<p>5/ <i>A rumor that Wintersession is going away.</i> Same answer as #3. There was absolutely nothing said to this effect at the two recent campus meetings. I have noted upon my arrival in last June that such rumors have been at RISD for decades.</p>\n<p>To be clear, at the two recent campus meetings I said nothing with respect to #4 or #5. Nor did I mean anything to this effect. As President I will be looking to the recommendations of the Provost for all academic related matters. For all other matters I will be looking to the rest of the President&#8217;s Advisory Council. My responsibility as President is to weigh the different input from all constituents and to make decisions and supporting arguments on behalf of our institution.  These analyses and input go to the Board of Trustees for final deliberations &#8211; the Board of Trustees has final decisions on all matters. </p>\n<p>Importantly, I should note that in my travel through College Building, a faculty person came up to me trembling with great emotion to say, &#8220;I will be guarding &#8230; the educational mission &#8230; of our institution.&#8221; My response to her was that I will be doing the same. </p>\n<p><b>C. Financial rumors that were all unfounded:</b></p>\n<p>6/ <i>A rumor that there are other outstanding loans in addition to the two that were mentioned above that I had not disclosed.</i> There are absolutely no such undisclosed financial arrangements. To explain, RISD undergoes a comprehensive yearly process of an external audit of our finances. The most recent audit, managed by our Controller Kelly Morra, achieved the highest ratings possible &#8211; &#8220;zero material issues.&#8221; As President I am ultimately responsible for the audit quality of our finances. I distinctly recall the auditors complete jaw-dropping awe for the work of Kelly and her team. Apparently the years before Kelly were described as the difference between &#8220;night and day.&#8221; The accuracy of our audit reflects that there is nothing out there that has not been disclosed. Case is closed.</p>\n<p>7/ <i>A rumor that there are abandoned buildings that RISD owns in Providence that should be sold.</i> There are no such buildings in the RISD inventory. I have checked this multiple times and believe it is urban legend that such buildings exist.</p>\n<p>8A/ <i>A comment that RISD should sell off some of its properties.</i> At first glance that makes sense in emergency, however there are two realities: 1) the market for real estate right now is extremely weak &#8211; common sense says that one should never sell in a market without customers, and 2) any revenue from a sale would be a one-time gain &#8211; since we need to manage a yearly and permanent budget reduction such a sale would only help us for one year. Perhaps in the future when the real estate market recovers, and there is enough support on campus to recommend the sale of an ineffective property to the Board then that day may come. Amidst this global financial crisis however, such a sale is highly unlikely. </p>\n<p>8B/ <i>A comment that RISD should sell off the President&#8217;s House because John does not live in it.</i> I do live in it, but nowhere to the extent that the Mandles did. I understand that Brown&#8217;s President Ruth Simmons is quite similar in behavior. Frankly as Presidents come, I&#8217;ve never been driven by the trappings of this office; I do figure that in my role as steward of the office of the President of RISD, that the 17th President (I&#8217;m number 16) should be given the opportunity to use it like the Mandles once did. In the meantime I will be using the house to build support for RISD student talent as I did recently <a href=\"http://www.tinochow.com/blog/2009/02/meeting-of-the-creative-minds-at-the-presidents-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\">with the Mayor,</a> as the official venue to thank scholarship supporters, and to showcase our faculty&#8217;s unique intellectual qualities. The logic of #8A holds as well because there are no potential buyers.</p>\n<p>9/ <i>A comment that we need to think of &#8220;new revenue generation&#8221; instead of just &#8220;belt tightening.&#8221;</i> I am absolutely certain that through this process as the community is mobilized here online and also offline, that many new ideas will be generated. It will be important to bring back ideas from decades ago as well that were left &#8220;on the cutting floor&#8221; as the expression is used in the film-making industry. Some ideas that have come up in meetings that won&#8217;t work in this economy: 1) A suggested RISD publishing arm &#8211; book publishers are going out of business so this market is too weak to enter, 2) A sale of faculty and student work for scholarships &#8211; galleries are closing in this economy so the market for art is significantly diminishing, 3) A T-shirt business like Threadless.com &#8211; it is better to partner with an existing business than to attempt to make our own from scratch. That said, some of the ideas that have come my way feel like given the right timing there could be some new possibilities. So I urge everyone to keep their ideas coming.</p>\n<p>There is nothing more important right now to me than fundraising and friendraising for RISD. It was a good friendship that resulted in the amazing LED lighting installation in Nature Lab worth several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Such friends take years to develop.</p>\n<p>In a weak economy like this, the groundwork that I will do with the rebuilt Institutional Engagement team will pay off in the long run, but is unlikely to affect our budget next year. As is said in the fundraising business it is important to avoid the situation where our patrons say, &#8220;You only come and see me to ask for money or when I have money.&#8221; So the ongoing efforts to engage them right now when everyone&#8217;s spirits are down is critical and meaningful for RISD&#8217;s long-term future. And I can assure you that we are also on the active look out for short-term gains that can be had as well. </p>\n<p>Phew. That was a long post. </p>\n<p>Keep on thinking, RISD. -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As a historian, I would like to speak to the question posted yesterday of how RISD managed through other times of economic crisis. It is my conclusion that RISD has: 1) repeatedly endured global financial crisis that were brought about by the excesses of competitive capitalism, and 2) used that experience to reaffirm its core mission of empowering individual artists and designers through what could be called a pioneering commitment to social entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>To begin before the beginning, the first American design schools were for women, set up at the dawn of the woman&#8217;s movement to empower women in a changing and uncertain economy. RISD was born a quarter century later during the four-year depression that followed the Panic of 1873. The coalition of interests that got these design schools off the ground included manufacturers, but the more interesting story to me now is RISD&#8217;s stubborn commitment to individual artists and designers and the alternative universe of the modestly self-employed.</p>\n<p>The founder of RISD, Helen Rowe Metcalf, never forgot the experience of moving to Providence as an orphaned teenager trying to start a new business with her siblings. (Two of her three brothers died in the process.) She spent her late teens and early 20s in Providence during a time of crisis over no money (read the letters in the RISD Archives), rapid industrialization, new media (the telegram) and new means of transportation (trains &amp; steamboats) that allowed information to spread &#8220;instantly&#8221;. Young Helen Rowe lived with central figures in the founding of the woman&#8217;s rights movement. And I think people will be surprised to learn how radically committed this group of New York transplants were to social and economic justice regardless of class, gender, or race. </p>\n<p>In the ensuing century after RISD&#8217;s founding, Helen Rowe Metcalf&#8217;s leadership and legacy made sure that RISD resisted. RISD resisted being elite like Brown. It resisted the inclusion of a (white-collar) engineering school in favor of a hands-on &#8220;shop knowledge&#8221; approach to educating thinking makers. Throughout the 20th c, RISD resisted becoming &#8220;only&#8221; an art school like so many of the other design schools started in the late 19th century that let go of their design school foundations. I love the fact that the name of this place is the RHODE ISLAND School of Design. It isn&#8217;t the Metcalf School of Design, or the name of some other donor. (And we should stop to realize how unusual this is: Brown, Cooper Union, Pratt, Parsons, Vassar &#8212; to name a few with ties to a RISD history.) </p>\n<p>A counter-point to this &#8220;RISD Resists&#8221; motif occurred near the end of the Great Depression. I am always sad to read the self-image of Industrial Design at RISD in the 1940s when the will to resist failed: &#8220;In general, the industrial designer is prepared to create items which the advertising man brings to the attention of the public&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;. Design is an adjunct of merchandizing and manufacturing.&#8221; &#8220;1946-7: The Division of Product Development: Advertising, Fashion Illustration, ID.&#8221; Luckily, happily, this was a short erratic move.</p>\n<p>Today we are hung over from a time of &#8220;irrational exuberance&#8221; when the future was mortgaged and individual wage earners awake today to worry about their jobs and mortgages. But this is in many ways a familiar story and a return to one of the conditions that founded design schools as a type of institution. (Probably one reason why RISD grad applications are up.)</p>\n<p>I still believe our job as educators at RISD is to mentor each student to the fullness of their unique potential so that they can go forth with passion and self-confidence to reshape a challenge into an opportunity and to insist that a bigger dream is possible. RISD&#8217;s job is also to be a village of elders strong enough to tolerate, guide, and eventually shape these independent voices into members of a whole community of humankind. This long-term investment is related to but different from the short-term goal of having each student have a job upon graduation. Business entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship have different metrics of &#8220;success&#8221;, leading to different curricula and different kinds of faculty. How can these often-conflicting goals be held in productive tension?</p>\n<p>One lesson from the past still relevant today would have to be about the insecurity of wage labor and the dangers of debt. These insecurities, in part, inspired the 19th c. design school movement. I might observe that a financial crisis such as the present one reminds wage earning RISD employees of their own job insecurity, as witnessed by writers in this blog. This current financial crisis might be an opportunity for a new solidarity between the full-time faculty and the backbone of long-term part-time faculty who have never had that benefit. </p>\n<p>This also should be a time for innovative educational initiatives. Alternative and underground art and design schools are being established everywhere. There is no reason RISD cannot use this opportunity to be as creative as possible. As I finish researching a biography of RISD&#8217;s founder, I am struck by the timely concerns expressed in the Rowe siblings&#8217; newspaper of long ago. How can creative workers create cooperative communities to control their own labor? RISD has always been committed to the WORK of art in a community. </p>\n<p>Nancy Austin<br/>\nAdjunct faculty, Industrial Design<br/>\nIndependent Scholar\n</p><p/></div>",

As a faculty member who teaches in the museum on an almost daily basis, I would add that there is no need to apologize for the conservation and interpretation of works of art in a college of art and design.  Indeed, the idea of divesting ourselves of historical art makes no more sense than to set about erasing history per se.  John, thank you for reminding us that works in  collections such as ours should not be considered  financial commodities any more than works of music or literature are commodities. </p>\n<p>Indeed, in the big picture, our collections need to outlive all of us as well as future generations. The works entrusted to us for the public belong to everyone, including the busloads of school children who visit the galleries every day, this is to say nothing of our RISD students or the visiting scholars who use our museum for research.</p>\n<p>The idea of making new art to substitute the old (even if said in jest) is profoundly anti-historical. A single case in point comes to mind, Giorgio Ghisi&#8217;s sixteenth-century engraving entitled &#8220;Raphael&#8217;s Dream&#8221; currently conserved in our department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, and to be displayed in &#8220;The Brilliant Line&#8221; exhibition next fall. If you have never taken the time to take a serious look at this object, I suggest you visit Prints, Drawings, and Photos during open hours (W,F 10:00-12:30) and ask Emily Peters to bring it out for you. &#8220;Raphael&#8217;s Dream&#8221; is nothing if not sensational. The point is, there are thousands of such objects in the museum that we all depend upon for the education of our visual and historical imaginations. </p>\n<p>Mary Bergstein<br/>\nProfessor and Head<br/>\nHistory of Art + Visual Culture\n</p><p/></div>",

I think there should be a check on why there are complaints, but obviously they are doing something that may upset people who pay to go here.

Aside from reading this illuminating strand I had no concept of how &#8220;bad&#8221; things were for RISD. I am not offering to sacrifice unduly, but if it were explained to me, as well as the rest of the student population, that times are tight then I would certainly be willing to participate in more thrifty practices. </p>\n<p>I also would like to say that it seems this challenging economy is conveniently coinciding with a growing trend to conserve environmentally. I think these two things align in exciting ways, and it is a perfect time to assess spending through the lens of sustainability. We should look inward for institutional redundancies in purchasing and consuming, and take recycling and reusing much more seriously. Why buy new when there are such quantities of supplies in storage all across campus? In my experience with the 2nd Life Center it is merely a matter of communication to get a product from the provider (or storage) to the user. As far as students&#8217; supplies are concerned, I hope that 2nd Life will see more active participation in gathering and sharing materials and viewing things as more valuable and less disposable. </p>\n<p>Personal plug: <a href=\"http://2ndlife.risd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2ndlife.risd.edu</a> is officially up and running!\n</p><p/></div>",

I was at the Student Alliance Department Representative meeting this week and all that was said is that we have to wait until next week to find out anything.

Now I don&#8217;t know if this is true but work study is a large factor for me and many of my friends in our ability to stay and pay for risd.

        "content": "<div><p>Having just returned from an unexpectedly extended sabbatical, I have been out of it. So I respectfully ask for your indulgence. I may be clueless and in grave error.<br/>\nThis budget business is very worrying. While I instinctively side with those who argue for people first, things second, and thank my colleagues like Jonathan Highfield and Mairead Byrne for having the courage to take a stand that they know will not be embraced by the deciding powers, I wonder if we shouldn&#8217;t ask questions about the putative shortfall before we scramble to fight over which things or people to jettison.<br/>\nDoes anybody but me wonder about the 5 fold increase in the projected deficit &#8211; from $2m to $10m &#8211; in about a week? Is it too skeptical to think that $10 is a suspiciously &#8220;perfect&#8221; number: round, even, and with no untidy decimals? Or that the week in which the explosion in losses supposedly occurred coincided with a meeting of the Board of Trustees? Now, in fairness, I was unable to attend either of the campus info sessions hosted by John Maeda. So maybe the figure as well as its etiology was well explained. But the people who attended whom I spoke to could not explain with any specificity how the $10m shortfall occurred. There was something about servicing skyrocketing debts and increases in salaries and benefits, and, of course, the claim of a perennially underperforming endowment. But the endowment does not contribute a great deal to the operating budget &#8211; historically it was 8% of revenues; I don&#8217;t know what it is now. But assuming 8% of $134m operating budget, that yields approximately $10.7m (note the pesky decimal). Now, I had heard (perhaps incorrectly) that the endowment took a relatively light hit (compared to the S&amp;P, Dow, and my 401K) of 22% over the past year. That would amount to a decrease of between $2.3m and $2.4m. But we all know about the rolling average formula, so this would not hit us with anything like the full force until 2011. It is good that the school is looking at the medium and long term. But might the administration/trustees be overreacting to some admittedly bad economic news and perhaps to some dubious financial institutional decisions of the recent past? I wonder. I can understand an endowment dependent school like Harvard in crisis. But we are a tuition dependent school and as far as I have heard, our expected undergraduate enrollments are not forecasted to dip next year and our graduate enrollments could theoretically rise. Continuing Education is a growth sector generally so could we not absorb some of the losses by ramping up CE? I know we have grown considerably and spent lavishly over the past decade and perhaps this growth is no longer sustainable. Unfortunately we probably cannot and do not wish to unload new buildings.<br/>\nAs I said, I am with those who would rather dispose of some unexhibited art works than shed any members of RISD&#8217;s &#8220;family&#8221;. We can engage in endless discussions about the commodification of people and of things, but I think that horse has long ago bolted from the barn. The classical political economists settled that in the early 19th century: people&#8217;s labor is a commodity, whether celebrated by Smith or deplored by Marx. As for things, well, even art is a commodity. That&#8217;s why a price tag is typically associated with them. And I&#8217;m not yet convinced that selling objets d&#8217;art is a wasted effort. Why do I bother, since John has made it abundantly clear that this is off the table: people are expendable but cultural artifacts, however iconic, are not? But I will just make one point. To all those who argue that auctioning off priceless but rarely if ever seen pieces (an analog argument would be that we cannot fire teachers who rarely if ever teach or staffers who rarely if ever work), I would just note the recent auction of the collection of the late Yves Saint Laurent. Two bronze fountainheads fetched $36m; a Matisse garnered $41m &#8211; a record price for a French artist; an Eileen Gray armchair reeled in $28m; a Brancusi sold for $33m and a Mondrian got $25m &#8211; twice the pre-auction estimate. So evidently some people have big bucks to buy exquisite samples of immortality. Maybe they would care to throw a few millions at a struggling art and design school. Think too about the death spiral that could ensue from laying off faculty and staff. Our reputation would suffer as would our services. Enrollments might then drop necessitating further self-lacerating cuts. Perhaps this is why the President of Brown engaged in an exemplary salary sacrifice and the President of Salve Regina said recently that layoffs would do more to injure the institution&#8217;s standing than anything else and therefore she would not authorize any despite the prospect of declining enrollments.<br/>\nI wonder too at the need to fix things by March 31. It may be necessary to address aspects of the problem immediately, but all of it? I still marvel at the $10m sum. I would like a detailed explanation for what amount of dollars we will lose in 2009-10 and what unforeseen expenses we will incur over the same period. I think at least some of the discussion should revolve around that, as well as discussing how we can economize.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Thanks for a hugely substantial post, Scott.  </p>\n<p>I would also like accurate figures on the value of the museum collection.  At a meeting in January, Hope said &#8220;billions of dollars.&#8221;  How many billions, and how much does the collection cost to secure and insure, and what is the annual rate of growth of the collection (including purchase of contemporary art), its value, and insurance costs?  What is the nature of the partnership between the school and museum?  Does the collection have a quality of &#8220;oneness&#8221; which is more compelling than that of the labor force of the school?</p>\n<p>I know there is a climate of fear around discussing these questions.  I was ridiculed in public by a staff member I don&#8217;t really know because I asked a question about museum assets at last month&#8217;s meeting.  I am also very apprehensive about offending my friends and colleagues, whom I very much respect.  We may differ in training and commitments but such difference (diversity) is crucial in an educational environment.  Students of art and design should be engaged in this discussion.  And we should commit to a safe environment for discussion, without personal attack or slight, in the knowledge and confidence, and joy, that diversity is real. </p>\n<p>As with (part of) President Maeda, there is an &#8220;artist in me that doesn&#8217;t believe that work should be revered.&#8221;  Twenty years ago I wrote an article called &#8220;Souvenirs of Survival&#8221; about the paintings of a group of my contemporaries in Ireland.  I understood the paintings as brilliant productions of the spirit.  Although I loved everything about their materiality&#8211;smell, color, texture&#8211;their spirit and energy were primary.  I felt that the paintings were traces, often awkward traces, of an ongoing struggle and energy.  That&#8217;s just the way I understood art, and probably still do.  It&#8217;s not a recipe for anyone else.  Everything is in the use, the present and future tense, for me.  I am intensely interested in history too but get overwhelmed easily by accumulation.   I love libraries, but want the precious books to be on the open shelves.  A beautiful ceiling is not a necessity in a library.  The beauty and necessity are elsewhere.  I&#8217;ve been in heaven in the box-like libraries of Cornell and Brown, when they have what I want.  An inquiry about the assets of the museum does not automatically mean Philistinism, whatever that is.  A conversation about selling art is not only circumstantial at an art school, it&#8217;s central.  Can minds meet in the museum to engage openly with critical issues?\n</p><p/></div>",

I don&#8217;t feel &#8220;bad&#8221; for you, John, in having inherited this financial situation - I am actually relieved you are at the helm. Thank You.</p>\n<p>As every other faculty and staff member, I too wonder about the relationship between school and museum. I am reading tension in some of the above posts - people attempting to defend the vast accumulation at the museum, as well as those who feel it is expendable. Perhaps we should look at the issue from a different perspective; Why can&#8217;t we SLIM down the collection? Why can&#8217;t we look at the assets our glorious museum has and decide what should be retained and what should be SHARED with others? I am not an artist (I draw stick people), but correct me if I am wrong, isn&#8217;t art supposed to be viewed / appreciated? I am sure that in my years at RISD I have been completely unable to view all of the art kept in storage. Why aren&#8217;t we rotating and sharing the beauty that is art &amp; artifact? Just a question to a plausible idea.</p>\n<p>As I read through posts on differing issues here, I note that there are those - as the original anonymous poster stated - &#8220;can see those who feel as though RISD should be operating as it did 10 years ago and are unwilling to budge from their belief - or raise a finger to help in the current crisis&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Opinions are like noses - everyone has one and each one is different. </p>\n<p>In this time of financial question and survival, I would find it very disheartening to find that staff and faculty alike are not willing to look at EVERYTHING - every suggestion  - in an effort to determine if it were in fact plausible.

        "content": "<div><p>In response to a call for understanding the relationship between the Museum and College, I&#8217;d like to offer an historical perspective. </p>\n<p>Last spring, I organized an exhibition at the Museum outlining the early history of collecting, which was on view for 6 months until this past October. It featured 40 drawings from the collection, most of them purchased and immediately given to the school by Mrs. Eliza Radeke in the early 20th century. Eliza Radeke, the daughter of the founder of RISD (Mrs. Helen Adelia Rowe Metcalf) was President of the Board of Trustees from 1913 until 1931. She simultaneously brought RISD to national recognition and built the Museum collection. She saw absolutely no division between these two goals. Mrs. Radeke tirelessly searched for objects of all types that would enhance the education of students at RISD. She bought things specifically with students of art and design in mind, and you can see this in the types of drawings she bought&#8212;Degas&#8217; exquisite &#8220;Ballet Girl,&#8221; and Ingres&#8217; unparalleled graphite sketch of a young dandy, both of which hundreds of students see each year in Foundation class visits brought to the Museum by Tom Mills, Gwen Strahle, Leslie Hirst, Nicholas Evans-Cato, Joanne Stryker, and many others. </p>\n<p>In my research, I discovered that Mrs. Radeke was the ONLY example of an early museum benefactor who did not buy first for herself&#8212;she bought first for RISD and only rarely kept something for herself in her private home. Contributing over 500 drawings to the collection, as well as to every department in the Museum, these gifts include irreplaceable examples by Parmigianino, Anthony van Dyck (an astounding chalk study of one of his most expressive figures), and Jessie Wilcox Smith (an female illustrator who was in Mrs. Radeke&#8217;s time, a contemporary artist). As Maureen O&#8217;Brien pointed out, these objects were meant to enter the public trust to be &#8220;of immediate and permanent use&#8221; (Mrs. Radeke&#8217;s words) in the education of students AND the public. Mrs. Radeke was a particular type of donor (and organizer, and leader) who shaped this amazing and unique place we call RISD today. There are numerous other examples in our history, and to sell works so entrusted to our care understandably does not sit well with those of us who have dedicated our careers to Mrs. Radeke&#8217;s educational mission here at the Museum.  </p>\n<p>Now, to access.</p>\n<p>Any and all of these drawings (which we rotate from galleries because of their susceptibility to light) are available for study in the Minskoff Center for Prints, Drawings, and Photographs. I get over 800 objects out of storage each semester for classes and personal visits (and in response to Anonymous, we do have climate control at the Museum like all buildings, but not hot/cold/warm/damp rooms&#8211;it&#8217;s an interesting idea, but let&#8217;s keep to the facts, please). A comparable number of objects are also pulled from our Costume and Textiles collection for viewing by Textiles, Apparel, and Liberal arts classes (the History of Dress survey has been taught in the Museum directly from objects for years). Both of these collections are susceptible to changes in environment and light, and yet both collections are rotated frequently (calls to rotate in previous posts are certainly heeded&#8211;just check out recent changes in the Asian textile gallery, the works on paper galleries, 20th century galleries, and newly installed Renaissance gallery).  Almost all of our exhibitions are generated from the existing collection.  </p>\n<p>If you wonder if this art is being viewed and appreciated, please, ask around! We&#8217;ve welcomed literally thousands (yes&#8211;thousands) of visitors in the last few months not to mention the hundreds (yes! hundreds!) of classes that take place in the Museum each year. I would gladly answer any other questions about how our collection is used and seen.\n</p><p/></div>",

Thank you for adding more knowledge to the pool of knowledge that we all share. I am looking for an institutional viewpoint on the matter and the more voices heard, the better. We should remind ourselves that we are <i>one</i> RISD &#8212; and that the Museum and the College are not just two parts of RISD, but together *are* what makes RISD. </p>\n<p>The presentation that I gave on Monday and Tuesday was intended to provide a snapshot of where we currently find ourselves. To be clear, in FY08-09 we are 13% dependent upon our endowment &#8212; we can argue whether that number is large or small, yet we know it is significant for RISD. Furthermore, the endowment and debt visualizations presented on Mon/Tue are only parts of a larger analysis which will put our ongoing enrollment challenges and deferred maintenance issues into perspective. Other schools may have similar and/or different financial issues, so they will act similarly and differently to RISD. The lack of consistency you will see in how other not-for-profits manage through this current world situation is because while we are all similar in overarching structure we are unique in our missions, the circumstances in which we operate, and the constituencies we serve.</p>\n<p>As for exemplary self sacrifices as your President, I look at what I can do for RISD as more in terms of ways in which I can better serve RISD&#8217;s future whether that be by my initiating a major scholarship fund with my wife, or by being a top contributor to our Annual Fund. I have already done both. You can call that a salary sacrifice in one dimension, or you can call that a personal investment by your President in RISD&#8217;s future growth. I prefer the latter, and I believe in it.</p>\n<p>We only need to look to the recent address by President Obama, to the economic situation that grips our world and to how all of our families are currently being affected to realize that there is  urgency. Next year is unlikely to be better as there are so many unknowns. The only factor that I as your President know for certain is that if by preparing this year we are more likely ready to weather the next.</p>\n<p>It is important that we all be on the same page, and that is why I urge all Faculty and Staff to come to our future campus conversations so that we can become one. I will be addressing the Student leadership next week on Monday to bring them aboard as well. </p>\n<p>Thanks and regards, JM\n</p><p/></div>",

However after reading these comments I&#8217;m going to say that I&#8217;d rather see RISD rely more heavily on the sale of artwork from the museum than faculty layoffs. As we move toward a more balanced budget with fewer unnecessary expenditures, the current budget crisis could hopefully be a short term problem, and selling artwork makes sense as a short term fix. However I think both should be a part of the solution so to minimize loss from any one area. I too take course evaluations seriously and think they should be considered during this process. I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing some work study jobs cut even though I take advantage of it myself, though I doubt this has a very large impact. I wonder, though, if expanding work study in some cases could actually help. For instance, some schools allow students to work in OIT. Some dining facilities are heavily staffed and sometimes managed by students. It&#8217;s something to consider.\n</p><p/></div>",

Hope it&#8217;s OK to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/education/28college.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to it</a><br/>\nWe may have lost endowment revenue but thankfully our enrollment is not down, and tuition, not the endowment, is our principal source of income.  In a sense, right now we can almost be thankful RISD is not endowment-dependent and invest everything we can in the academic program and financial aid.  While some small colleges are suspending building projects, we have already done the building: the academic program must be protected from the vast debt incurred by that (the annual interest on our debt is not far removed from the annual income from our endowment).  While some small colleges have reduced adjunct faculty, these seem to be colleges which also have reduced enrollments.  Financial Aid, to which small colleges are committing to above all, according to the New York Times, was very weak at RISD long before the current crisis.  Our challenge is to make a long overdue investment in the academic program and financial aid even in this crisis: not dissimilar to Obama&#8217;s educational commitments.\n</p><p/></div>",

RISD has held 100 million impressions (an impression is access to a viewer/reader out there) per quarter nationally and internationally in strong contrast to previous years hovering at a few million per quarter. A stronger name and reputation means a stronger tendency to apply in spite of the weakening economy. Open this month&#8217;s ID Magazine and see <a href=\"http://www.id-mag.com/article/risd/\" rel=\"nofollow\">our Nature Lab</a> shine for the world and you will feel the RISD pride. We have much work and challenges in sustaining our current enrollment and applicant pool, and I want to give a special thanks to the faculty on the Admissions Committee, and to the staff supporting that committee, for all their fine work in reviewing the incoming generation of RISD talent. It is extremely hard and important work &#8212; thank you!</p>\n<p>As for the ongoing comments wrt art sales as a short-term solution, there will be details forthcoming of an on-campus forum to engage an intellectual discussion on this question. I&#8217;m sure that the world can benefit from understanding how RISD thinks in this area as possibly differing from Brandeis (just google &#8220;Brandeis Rose Art Museum&#8221; to sample some of the controversy), we are an art school and most certainly have a few differing takes than their institution and others may have. I feel that if RISD can&#8217;t have this conversation in an intelligent manner, then nowhere really can. </p>\n<p>I came here to RISD to learn, and I am learning a great deal together with all of you about how RISD exists. So to share what I have come to learn, it&#8217;s important to note that the way a Museum works is that an acquisition like the Warhol polaroids comes in as a gift with the expectation that the object will sit with the institution in perpetuity. It&#8217;s different from being given a bar of gold, and then assuming that it&#8217;s possible to sell that bar of gold later by converting it into money. An analogy is that if I had an ancient book I&#8217;ve held in my family for many generations, and then gave it to the Smithsonian for them to keep forever, and then I were to learn that the Smithsonian had sold it later &#8230; then my relationship with the Smithsonian would be broken. Every object in any museum has a relationship with the donor that contributed the piece. As a scholar of &#8220;simplicity&#8221; I can only wish that it were all less complex. But it isn&#8217;t. And that is why having a forum will help us all understand better and together.</p>\n<p>In a slightly related context, I read this article in the IHT about <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/24/africa/24museum.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">the museum</a> in Baghdad that was looted and is only now getting back onto its feet. I can&#8217;t imagine what it means to the Iraqi people to see their museum, and their cultural history, becoming restored. And yes for those that are trying to survive day to day, it is unlikely that they care about their museum at all. And yet for scholars I imagine that their feeling is much different because they feed not only on food but also knowledge. My decision on the matter will hinge on understanding as many sides as I possibly can (please refer to <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/maedas-three-resolutions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my Rule #3</a> as your president). </p>\n<p>Many students have come up to me over the months to voice an opinion &#8212; and that is to speak to the fine arts more. What&#8217;s interesting is the name of our school. &#8220;Rhode Island School of <b>Design</b>&#8221; &#8212; which I can imagine if you self-associate with being a &#8220;designer&#8221; you feel represented, and as an &#8220;artist&#8221; you feel unrepresented. As both a designer and as an artist I can understand your feelings. I believe that the early founders of RISD recognized this tiny &#8220;bug&#8221; and thus the &#8220;RISD Museum of <b>Art</b>&#8221; in some senses was an attempt to form a balance. There is a new book by Dean Dawn Barrett (currently on sabbatical) and RISD Archivist Andy Martinez entitled <i>Infinite Radius</i> that helps to paint the picture of the origins of our school, and also the complex history that we all inherit today. Fine Arts and the Liberal Arts are areas that early RISD leaders had the vision to fully integrate into our intellectual fabric as an institution &#8212; a lot lot lot has happened in 132 years here in Providence, Rhode Island at our school and museum. And we can expect a lot more will happen in the next 132 years. </p>\n<p>RISD survived the great depression of the 1930s. RISD survived the great oil crisis of the 1970s. RISD survived the two world wars and the many wars that have happened since 1877. RISD will survive the current situation we face together right now. </p>\n<p>Thank you, and have a great Sunday! -JM</p>\n<p>PS On Prof. Byrne&#8217;s comment regarding the NYT article on RI it&#8217;s important to note that we are <a href=\"http://www.tinochow.com/blog/2009/02/meeting-of-the-creative-minds-at-the-presidents-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\">actively engaging</a> our local government in new ways.

Similarly, I would argue, students and departments do not like to see programmatic cuts, particularly when the program is run effectively. The academic program at RISD is not at the core of the economic difficulty the school (and the museum?) is facing. While the museum is also not entirely responsible, it could be argued that focusing the capital campaign on expanding the museum is one of the reasons we are not in as sound financial shape as we would like to be. Perhaps the cost of the Chace Center is the divestment of a select number of items in order to ensure that the school and the museum go into the next 132 years financially sound.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>In response to Professor Highfield, my understanding is that the Museum faces an even greater financial impact than the College. Its operating expenses are dependent upon interest from a fixed portion of the endowment, that which the Board of Trustees determined as the amount that was specifically and historically raised by and for the Museum. Consequently, according to information made public to the Museum staff last week, the Museum will be expected to cut close to 30% of its budget (largely staff costs), as opposed to the general College hit of about 8%. It will still have the same responsibility to serve RISD&#8217;s private and public academic mission. The Museum&#8217;s budget is a relatively small percentage of the overall RISD budget and it subsidizes a significant portion of its activities (programs, exhibitions, renovations, to name a few) through grants. And for the record, there is absolutely no basis in the statement made by the first anonymous blogger that the Museum runs over budget. It does not. </p>\n<p>Aside from the Museum&#8217;s security guards, its staff does not belong to a bargaining unit, and it willingly accepts the institution&#8217;s need for a zero percent pay increase &#8212; that which the President and Trustees have recommended across the board. Like other non-union staff across campus, most would opt to remain at RISD even at reduced wages.</p>\n<p>With regard to the proposal that the sale of art could solve part of the financial dilemma, we are relieved that there will soon be an open conversation on this issue.<br/>\nLegal restrictions, gift restrictions, museum ethics, public trust, historic mission, and RISD&#8217;s public and private academic program are all parts of this question. It will be good<br/>\nget the facts on the table. As President Maeda pointed out, it is not as simple as cashing in a bar of gold.</p>\n<p>As for the suggestion that the Museum should &#8220;pay&#8221; for the Chace Center by selling art, some clarification of the Center&#8217;s origins and purpose are in order. This highly- functioning addition to the One-RISD program was made possible through a major gift (the largest in RISD&#8217;s history) that was offered by the donors to the Museum, for the purpose of the Museum&#8217;s expansion. In an outstanding partnering of programs and unity of goals, RISD&#8217;s Trustees agreed to leverage that leading gift to create a building that serves the needs of the Museum and College equally. If you tour the building you will note that two floors address Museum activities: the third floor exhibition gallery which has already generated more public use and revenue than the Museum has ever seen; and the fourth floor Prints, Drawings, and Photographs storage and classrooms, providing students and faculty with increased access to collection for personal and curriculum use, and freeing up space in the 1926 building for a 20th century gallery, print and photography galleries, and a classroom, all serving the curriculum. Two floors of the Chace Center are exclusively for College use: the magnificent fifth floor Foundation studios, and the equally beautiful student galleries on the second floor. The ground floor serves many of our shared needs, including a new auditorium that has seen constant use from the day its doors opened. Add to that the students&#8217; piazza, the new home for RISDWorks, the cut-throughs from Main to Benefit Street, and toss in a biannual opportunity to showcase faculty in a space that honors their excellence. We all acknowledge that there are many other needs to address, but let&#8217;s not make the Chace Center, or the cost of the new Westminster dorms and Library construction, the scapegoat. Donors often choose to support bricks and mortar, and gifts like the Chace Center are called leading gifts because they set the bar high and draw greater support and attention to the overall campaign.</p>\n<p>Like other longtime RISD staff and faculty, including Professor Highfield, I am unequivocally committed to its mission, as are my colleagues &#8212; new and old &#8212; at the Museum. One has only to read Dr. Emily Peters&#8217;s eloquent post to understand the passion and conviction of that commitment and to acknowledge the fact that we are on the same team. I hope that future contributors to this thread will take that into consideration.</p>\n<p>Maureen O&#8217;Brien\n</p><p/></div>",

Our society is in the midst of both an environmental and economic crisis. As an institution, RISD should be implementing more responsible strategies concerning our energy and waste.  I think we&#8217;d surprise ourselves with the great fiscal benefits that would accompany. One idea in our proposal, inspired by Penn State, is to demand a school-wide commitment to responsible printing. By setting default margins at .75&#8221;, setting font size to 10 point and making double-sided printing the institutional norm, these measures could conservatively save the college $50,000 annually. This may seem like a small number in the grand scheme of things but could save one staff or faculty member from losing his/her job.

Laying off our colleagues is not only disastrous for those who are told to leave but for us, too, who are still here.  It is very disheartening to watch as people who have been an integral part of this &#8220;RISD Team&#8221; for 20 years or more just suddenly laid off (or were they fired?).  Thus, I think it natural for us to look at the Museum&#8217;s treasures which are objects, and are not human beings, as a way for us as a RISD Team to remain whole.   Obviously, the most treasured objects cannot be replaced and thus should not be let go.  And some treasures have close ties to donors.  And yet, it seems that the Museum could poke around its storage areas and find lesser treasures that could be let go which would not offend past or future donors.  Or maybe it&#8217;s one big treasure?  Do any of you remember THE eighteenth century Goddard desk at the Nightingale House on Benefit Street which was put on the auction block to finance the restoration of the house?  Estimated sale price at auction was $1 Million and the final sale was $12.1 Million, I believe.  As I remember, a carefully crafted reproduction was made in its place at a reasonable price.  At any rate, I am one who would suggest to the Museum, as part of the RISD Team, to start identifying a few treasures to possibly be sold now and/or within the next few years to lessen our own fiscal crisis.\n</p><p/></div>",

It could allow us to look at our own RISD stimulus package - how do we spend money (the famous economic anti-intuitive crisis behavior) and create wealth and access existing wealth.

        "content": "<div><p>Hello RISD-named and RISD-anonymi,</p>\n<p>First of all I&#8217;d like to remind us all of the importance of sustaining a <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/community-guidelines/\" rel=\"nofollow\">civil dialogue</a> in this forum. We live in the USA &#8212; a truly amazing country that allows for freedom of expression of all kinds. And especially for all people. We live in RISD &#8212; a place that is much more creative and freely expressive than the norm. It is why I ask everyone to sustain their creativity, and at the same time sustain their civility in these open forums. You have my thanks for your efforts to ensure that kindness prevails. </p>\n<p>130+ years of RISD history is a lot of years to cover. History is important because it tells us what worked, and what didn&#8217;t work. One doesn&#8217;t always need to look back to figure out what worked &#8212; they only need to look to here and the present to see what has stood the test of time. RISD is an example of strength that has been tested through many generations of challenges. So we stand together as a college and a museum since the late 1800s, and we stand now in 2009 as one institution. This formula is core to what RISD has been in the past, and will continue to be what it is in the future. So if you don&#8217;t have a kind thing to say about our museum, then realize that you are saying something negative about who we are as RISD as a whole. We are all RISD here.</p>\n<p>With respect to the importance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;design thinking&#8221;</a> I agree, and as your president and together with my staff we are taking this approach each step of the way amidst this ongoing global financial situation. Design thinking is about finding creative, respectful solutions. Design thinking is your president responding to the many questions and concerns in this way, and in realtime. Design thinking is all of us reading or writing or thinking-to-ourselves in this forum. </p>\n<p>To organize some of the dominant opinions presented above, preserving art for the future over jobs in the present is a stated issue. On the one hand I can see that viewpoint clearly, and on the other hand I can see that museums worldwide have the ethical responsibility to preserve their collections as a fact of how we exist. Were we not an art school and instead an institution that had nothing all to do with the creation of art (say a bank or insurance company), perhaps the question of which set of ethics might prevail would be clearer. But we are an educational institution that creates hundreds of talented &#8220;makers&#8221; each year that create objects by expending their own intense human capital. We are a much more deeply complex case of what we see happening with non-art-schools and their art. </p>\n<p>I recall visiting the <a href=\"http://www.gardnermuseum.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isabel Stewart Gardner</a> in my teenage years, and remember with wonderment the display of a Persian carpet that took 40-years to create &#8212; essentially a whole person&#8217;s life. It was then that I realized that the artist gives his or her life to what they create. This perspective &#8212; an artist&#8217;s perspective &#8212; is necessary when thinking about the nature of art and its preservation. Were there a simple, single, &#8220;right&#8221; absolute perspective to every issue in the world &#8230; then there would be no need for an educational institution to exist. </p>\n<p>Turning to the opinions regarding the Chace Center. I am aware of most of its history as coming out of the 1997 Strategic Plan led by President Mandle, and today I still continue to learn how difficult it must have been to lose the parking lot that once stood there. I understand it was a place to informally congregate, and can understand the kind of loss that was felt. At the same time the gain for the campus has been impressive. The Foundation Studies studios on the upper floors are spectacular, the Faculty Biennial is beautifully displayed there right now, and the Student Gallery is always a pleasure and pride to visit regularly. I see many academic lectures happen in the auditorium that make good use of the superior AV support. I understand there are some imperfections in how parts are scheduled and managed as is the same with all resources on campus as I have observed. Being a new resource on campus however, and with the collective care by all of the community I am certain that with time it will live and breathe in a way that will enhance our culture. </p>\n<p>With respect to Anonymous:4:43pm, thank you for that note on those houses. I referred to some sort of &#8220;abandoned factory building&#8221; that lives as a rumor. Regarding the space utilization issues you suggest above, thank you for noting the theory of space usage you present. All information (whether rumored or theorized) is useful to me right now so I am grateful.</p>\n<p>Last night I met with the Student Alliance and Graduate Student Alliance Executive Councils to give a tutorial on how the financial model of colleges work, and also was able to give a primer on endowments. Anonymous:2:02pm raises some theories by Dr. Simon Johnston and how colleges should use their endowments. As I presented in the two campus meetings last week, RISD&#8217;s endowment is not in the same scale category as endowments at schools like Harvard and Yale with massive excess in capital and we have different issues that are tied to how much our campus grew over the last decade. If you think of Harvard&#8217;s endowment as a corked, vintage bottle of fine wine, RISD&#8217;s endowment is more like a juicebox that has already been opened. </p>\n<p>I ask all of you to look back to two decades ago when RISD was much smaller. And now it&#8217;s so much larger today. President Mandle led a monumental campus expansion that has realized many buildings used to support our educational mission. And like all other institutions that expanded over the last two decades and that face this financial situation we find our world in today, we are left to manage what has happened. It is not constructive to wish away what has happened up to now because great things happened. I wake up every day with the single drive to ensure that great things happen for our RISD. And none of that will happen unless we choose to work together, instead of choose to working against each other. It is all a choice. It&#8217;s up to you. It is all up to the mind that sits behind the eyeballs that are reading this text. </p>\n<p>So as the sunset on anonymous day settles, I invite you to continue to contribute your thoughts in real name for the remainder of the week, or else wait until next Tuesday if that suits you better. Your comments are <i>always</i> useful to me in some way. </p>\n<p>I ask all of you to trust that I am doing the job that I was hired to do as your president &#8212; which is to make the many difficult decisions on behalf of our institution. Since we all carry different belief systems, priorities, and knowledge of the challenges we face, it will be impossible for me to make all decisions on behalf of RISD that you will agree with. But if you choose to trust that as your president and together with my staff we are making the necessary decisions based upon all the knowledge we can possibly gather, then you in turn can be freed to do the challenging work that you all do in your roles as Students, Faculty, and Staff of RISD. If RISD were simply ruled by named and anonymous voices on a blog, then we would likely only sit at an impasse. As your president, I am here to ensure that RISD does not sit at an impasse amidst these especially complex times.</p>\n<p>The world is undergoing incredible transformation as we speak. Focusing our attention on what we at RISD do for the world as an educational institution has the opportunity to make enormous impact in finding a path to our collective stability. Our students transform reality as they graduate and enter the world &#8212; this May, 500+ RISD students will soon be on their way as an important wave of critical thinking and critical making that the earth desperately needs. Just think of that, and hope is not too far from your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all of you for what you do here, and for what you do for our world. And let&#8217;s keep moving forward, RISD -John\n</p><p/></div>",

It would seem pretty important that they have the ability to access these and other points of view on two.risd. </p>\n<p>And, if I may,  just another thought about selling art: I don&#8217;t know enough about this to have a clear sense of the ultimate rightness or wrongness of this possibility (i.e. would anybody out there really want to buy RISD artworks? Would we even be able to raise significant funds that way? Are there works of art which the museum is allowed to sell within the guidelines or restrictions under which they were bequeathed or acquired?), but assuming the answers to these questions might be yes, I do want to pose this thought: who does art belong to?</p>\n<p>If we think of the making, showing, selling, buying, acquiring, bequeathing, viewing and trading art as an organic and communal process, maybe we would feel less rigid about ownership. I think of art objects as shareable, moveable, flexible, with huge and far reaching powers independant of ownership and provenance. We are lucky to have many marvelous pieces in our stewardship. But art never stands still. it isn&#8217;t in its nature. Does it ultimately matter which revered institution owns a work of art so long as people can see it and it is well cared for? (I don&#8217;t think anyone is suggesting we sell important artworks to gun runners or oil magnates &#8212; surely we can be proactive about selling to the right places.) If, for example, a piece is in the collection at the Boston MFA but then is acquired by the National Gallery in D.C. , isn&#8217;t it just as valuable, just as relevant, and just as important to the viewers? Couldn&#8217;t you argue that there are institutions who have the ability to steward works of art as well if not better than our RISD Museum? Couldn&#8217;t selling a few significant pieces actually be considered an act of preservation for those selected works?</p>\n<p>If RISD sold a few important and valuable pieces to well-known and world-renowned institutions, surely the artwork would remain vital, shared, seen, well cared for. Maybe it could be considered an act of generosity to let a few of our artworks flow out of our hands for awhile. Who knows what might replace them in the years to come? </p>\n<p>These are really just questions &#8212; some things to consider. If there were a few pieces whose sale might ultimately result in more students attending RISD, more faculty teaching students at RISD, and more staff being able to remain to help us all do what we do best: (teach, talk, consider, make, and challenge institutional conventions) mightn&#8217;t it really be our obligation to think about it seriously at the very least? Out of the 80,000+ works of art at our beloved and fabulous museum, maybe there are a few we could live without. Just wondering.\n</p><p/></div>",

I have not read every post, and I may have missed an unkind comment. However, most of the comments directed to the museum that I have read - and written - are directed to the collection, definitely not to the curators and other staff. We can debate the ethics of keeping a collection of art intact over keeping a collective staff intact at length. No piece of art has to explain to a loved one that she lost her job today. </p>\n<p>Your comment also suggests that there is or should be a policing of our comments at what is a traumatic time for many people at RISD, almost all of whom have been here longer than you and have an investment in the community of this institution which, at the least, equals your own.

And I cannot claim the ability to use words better than you, although I always aspire to learn. And I am learning from what you are saying here so thank you.</p>\n<p>In the world of art museums, the artifacts and the professionals associated with them are one and the same. I know it is a bit of a stretch to see that connection, but it is real and something I have become aware of by interacting with museum professionals worldwide. Although I am happy to argue the subtlety of semantics in my sentence that you highlight over tea sometime &#8212; words are such amazing things. </p>\n<p>FYI There was an excellent discussion arc on the <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/06/27/the-value-of-crits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;Crits&#8221;</a> strand that formed a solid discourse on acceptability and openness. The points you raise were raised earlier by Prof. Myers (July 2 / 1:21) in that strand. I am not in disagreement, and to be clear I have never policed anything on this blog or elsewhere. I have been openly available, openly criticizable, and also dearly interested in all of your thoughts. </p>\n<p>I know that I cannot compare with the total length of service of all of the people here at RISD combined. There must be at least a million years here in all of you to my half year thus far. And yet as your president I expect all of you to expect from me an even higher degree of love than imaginable for our institution as your chief representative in the world. As president my job is to constantly represent all of RISD&#8217;s interests and to make the best possible decisions on your behalf. It is a daunting task that I accepted by becoming your 16th president. The ongoing global financial crisis is not something any of us expected, but it is a situation that I&#8217;ve accepted, and am currently managing with all my might together with my staff. </p>\n<p>For all 3000+ of you to feel comfortable with me as your leader within the short time we&#8217;ve been together I know is difficult. But I will never give up trying, and will be here to talk with all of you as much as I can. </p>\n<p>Finally, thank you for the reference to the work of <a href=\"http://www.susanrobb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Susan Hobb</a>. Interesting. PS I was already a Carlin fan (smile).</p>\n<p>Best, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I have been looking at all the entries in this strand of two.risd, and I think they are fascinating snapshots of the current mood at RISD. They show how much everybody from every area of RISD cares about this institution and its people, and how hard we are all trying to find solutions to this financial crisis that will minimize lay-offs or having to sell artworks from the Museum. These are a few thoughts on our current predicament:</p>\n<p>RISD is like a highly complex and sensitive ecosystem. It is very hard for any one of us to understand completely the infinite network of personal relationships that exists between students, faculty, and staff, or how it works to create what we know as RISD. We simply cannot foresee the effect that removing any one person from our community, be it faculty or staff, will have on the whole institution. I keep being reminded of the &#8216;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterfly effect</a>&#8216; in chaos theory, by which even minute variations from the initial conditions on any given system can have large-scale consequences on the long-term behavior of that system. Who or what will be the butterfly whose flapping of wings today will change the &#8216;weather patterns&#8217; at RISD for the foreseeable future? Knee-jerk reactions to the financial crisis at this juncture could have catastrophic effects for the long-term survival, not just of RISD, but of the larger community.</p>\n<p>I am acutely aware of our responsibilities as stewards of an illustrious inheritance, both material in the form of the museum&#8217;s artworks, and intellectual in the form of the RISD educational experience. Losing faculty or staff whose contributions are essential to the intellectual/spiritual/emotional life of our community could have results that we cannot begin to understand at present, as would losing any of the museum&#8217;s treasures.</p>\n<p>For all the above reasons, I urge everybody involved in the decision-making process at RISD to consider EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION before deciding on lay-offs or selling the museum&#8217;s artwork. Cost-cutting could range from energy-saving measures to flexible working practices that would allow us all to keep our jobs, and give those who need it the flexibility to care for children or sick relatives while still working at RISD. It could involve compressing the working week so that we do not have to spend more money on heating and lighting buildings than strictly necessary. As I keep reading in this blog, we are a creative community and, if we try hard enough, we can find ways of fulfilling our educational mission without laying people off. Try to imagine a RISD that is completely committed to preserving people&#8217;s jobs. What shape would it take? What sacrifices would be necessary to achieve that goal?</p>\n<p>Remember that once the cuts have been implemented, there is no turning back&#8230;.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello Bethany,</p>\n<p>You raise a very important question.  One of the key issues we face is the rising cost of a RISD education.  This is not a new issue, nor is it specific to RISD:  the cost of higher education has outpaced other major areas (such as health care, housing, cost of living, etc.) for several decades.  This has affected who can go to college, what colleges they can attend, and what kind of financial burden&#8212;in the form of lost opportunity and loans&#8212;students and their families face after graduation.  Indeed, it&#8217;s safe to say that we were in a kind of national crisis around issues of affordability and access prior to the present economic downturn.</p>\n<p>The changing economic circumstances have only amplified this pre-existing problem:  Houses that previously provided equity for student loans have lost value, parents have lost jobs, and major sources of income available for institutions of higher education (such as endowed funds) have declined in value.   </p>\n<p>For RISD, this means that we must take immediate steps to make a RISD education more affordable.  In the near term, we essentially have three ways to accomplish this:<br/>\n1) Reduce the cost basis (our annual budgets) for delivering a RISD education<br/>\n2) Reduce the rate of increases in tuition<br/>\n3) Increase financial aid</p>\n<p>In his presentations to the community, President Maeda was clear that we will be looking to make significant progress in all three of these areas simultaneously.  </p>\n<p>So the answer to your question is that RISD will, in general, be prioritizing the affordability of a RISD education going forward, and this will include (among other things) increases in the overall budget for financial aid.\n</p><p/></div>",

But, the To Do or Not To Do list needs to be founded on knowledgeable information on costs across RISD to create a clear united, informed, and useful understanding of applicable actions that we can begin to propagate.

Your collective sacrifice means a great deal for the future of RISD, and I personally promise to ensure that it will not be in vain.</p>\n<p>Today I spent time with some business leaders in NY and heard first-person what is read in the newspapers and media. One of my friend&#8217;s companies has already gone through four waves of layoffs. Another friend&#8217;s company is going through the 2nd wave of layoffs and paycuts across the board to try and stay afloat. We are living in truly extraordinary times that will require a monumental team effort to remain the leader of art and design schools. The task is unlike any other challenge in RISD&#8217;s recent history.</p>\n<p>Your leadership matters a great deal, and I know that you are counting on my leadership of RISD together with Jessie to ensure that our educational mission continues to be core to our institution. We take your trust most seriously.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>With respect to an official word out to the campus on this matter, I know it is important for the faculty to announce their decisions as a group on their own terms and not mine. Having been faculty before, I know this is a feeling/value that I believe lies at the heart of academic freedom as a professor. If there are faculty out there that wish for RISD to make an official announcement in some form, then the correct channel is to suggest it to the department heads, deans, and ultimately the provost. </p>\n<p>Thanks to the faculty, staff, and students for continuing to bring your ideas and energy forward, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

A hospital is a vastly different model from a college so everything that Paul is doing at Beth Israel doesn&#8217;t directly translate to RISD. The important takeaway from the article though &#8230; is one of empathy and listening. I&#8217;m here to hear. And am not going away. So thank you RISD for throwing as many ideas and thoughts as you have this way. </p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/03/08/obama_to_reach_out_to_some_taliban/?page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">article on Obama is interesting</a> from last week: </p>\n<p>in it Obama says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Part of the reason we don&#8217;t spend a lot of time looking at blogs,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is because if you haven&#8217;t looked at it very carefully, then you may be under the impression that somehow there&#8217;s a clean answer one way or another - well, you just nationalize all the banks, or you just leave them alone and they&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I read this I could understand how Obama feels, and yet at the same time felt badly for him that at his level of office he doesn&#8217;t have access to &#8220;the people&#8221; as he did before he became president. The issues at hand are extremely complex and seem to multiply daily. So, frankly, many of the answers posed in this strand simply don&#8217;t work. And yet I know that by being here and listening, I know it&#8217;s <i>all</i> helping me think. So thank you RISD for continuing to speak up.</p>\n<p>Best regards, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Charlotte, I was just in the development office yesterday and heard of your post. Apologies as my attention was diverted from the blog this weekend. Thanks for coming to the blog and voicing your concerns. With respect to &#8220;how to get the word out to students,&#8221; I have struggled with the question of <i>how</i> and could always use some help to better understand. Last nite I sat in Portfolio Cafe with three Photography students and talked about the financial situation, and also went on a jog with students across majors to explain the situation in the world right now. Each step of the way I am looking for *interactive* means of engaging the student body. It is my belief that an email amidst a busy student&#8217;s life would not be an effective means of communication. So when I spoke with the Student Alliance Executive Committee, it became clear that they are able to interact with students at a greater scale than I. And in a more natural way. My question to you would be how can we help improve Student Alliance meeting engagement, or *interactive* information dissemination in general? I&#8217;d like to see RISD move in an *interactive* way to speak with our constituents instead of faceless email messages in which it is difficult to present the greater context of what is an extremely complex picture. Thanks for any advice here/there.</p>\n<p>Hi Candy, Thanks for your thoughts. I&#8217;m learning every minute from people like David all over the world. Our situation here at RISD is similar to many, and yet uniquely different as well. As for my feelings for our institution, I believe that in my face-to-face engagements with the community I have made it clear. When you asked me at one of the open meetings, &#8220;Do you regret coming to RISD at this moment in time?&#8221; I answered unequivocally, &#8220;No.&#8221; I am honored to be here and to lead our proud proud community during these extremely challenging times. These times are not easy, and will not turn around soon unfortunately. But as a community in constant communication, we can find a softer landing in what is a hard reality of the global financial challenges. </p>\n<p>FYI With all of my siblings currently laid off from work, I find myself speaking with them on a regular basis. One was laid off from Microsoft, and has gone to community college to retrain herself for a new career with support from the city/state. Another, a lawyer, is working odd clerical jobs where he lives in California and is finding the strong work ethic that we all learned from our father is serving him particularly well. We find ourselves talking with each other again through these troubling times &#8212; as a family does. Americans survive through, as Prof. Hitchcock points out, remembering <i>&#8220;the body, the brain, and the heart.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p>Every iota of my body, brain, and heart is focused on RISD right now to pilot our ship forward. Thank you to everyone here for contributing your insights, criticism, creativity, curiosity, and good will in these difficult times.</p>\n<p>The sun is out today, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

She relayed that you were interested in setting up a #5 plastic collection at your school.  Seeing as I am the Program Manager for the Gimme 5 program here at Preserve, I thought I would introduce myself and present you with a couple options to get your school active in sending back #5 to be made into Preserve Products.</p>\n<p>Bonnie and I have discussed logistics and we think it would be perfectly workable to have you collect the material at RISD and take it to the University Heights Whole Foods to be incorporated into the environmentally-friendly backhaul shipping program we have set up.  You have a few options:<br/>\n1)\tWe could give you an official Gimme 5 bin.  If you want to pursue this option, you would have to pay $100 per bin.<br/>\n2)\tYou could also set up collections with your self-supplied containers &#8211; if you used cardboard boxes (as another university program is doing) the cost would be virtually free.<br/>\nIn either case, you would have to drop off the collected material at Whole Foods.  Bonnie has said that the material should be brought late in the afternoon &#8211; other than that, she will have to explain who to ask for or where to leave it, etc.</p>\n<p>How would you be running the program?  Were you planning on having a set collection drive, or set up a collection bin?  Someone should at least have a cursory glance through the material before it makes its way back into the system &#8211; even at stores we are receiving significant amounts of contamination.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me any questions to get this program started,<br/>\nJustin</p>\n<p>Associate Product Manager<br/>\nPreserve<br/>\n681 Main Street<br/>\nSuite 3-37<br/>\nWaltham, MA 02451<br/>\nPhone: 781/ 893-1032<br/><a href=\"http://www.preserveproducts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.preserveproducts.com</a></p>\n<p>Please note my new email address: <a href=\"mailto:justin.parker@preserveproducts.com\">justin.parker@preserveproducts.com</a></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>I think we at RISD should select some key areas to put containers and then bring them via RISD&#8217;s Facilities from time to time as they get full.

Anyway, what does the blog group think of this e-mail and any suggestions to getting this program off the proverbial ground would be great!\n</p><p/></div>",

Daily, our own facilities staff picks up after us all across campus.  Trash is emptied daily.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, litter still seems to plague RISD&#8217;s campus.  In particular, cigarette butts are all over the place, on all the sidewalks, outside of buildings, and in the gutters.  Until some designer or scientist designs a toxin-free, biodegradable filter, those things are trash.  As a former smoker who struggled for years to break free of this insidious habit and addiction (I quit 6 years ago) I find it sad to see all the young kids hanging out smoking, then tossing their butts on the ground.   I don&#8217;t think it looks good for our school and it&#8217;s definitely not good for the environment.</p>\n<p>So you can&#8217;t make everyone quit.<br/>\nBut can we at least get some of those cigarette butt disposal chimney things for outside of the buildings where people smoke?  Can we encourage smokers, especially students, to hang on to their butts if there is no place to dispose of them? I know that pocketing smoked butts makes one&#8217;s clothes stinky, but there has to be a better way than throwing them on the ground.</p></div>",

With RISD cracking down on things like graffiti, and always worrying about its public appearance I am surprised that this issue has never been addressed. Also, after a conversation with Health Services, I was surprised to hear that there is a relatively low percentage of student on campus who smoke (or admit to it). I think it feels like many more because they are always standing in doorways. I think that every RISD building has a sign asking them not to- to stand further away, but that is rarely enforced, and I for one resent walking through another person&#8217;s cloud of stink in order to get to class, or my room. </p>\n<p>More importantly than my personal disgust is the rudeness that smokers display by littering.

        "content": "<div><p>In December of 2004 the RI Department of Health promulgated regulations restricting and prohibiting smoking in public spaces.  These regulations were based upon laws passed by the RI Legislation.  The regulations effectively caused all public buildings (RISD is considered public) to restricting smoking at doorways, near windows and in other areas that might expose people to second hand smoke.  In the regulations it was recommended that the 30 to 40 feet be the distance for smokers to keep back from entryways.  In the regulation posting signage in doors prohibiting smoking is required.  Because most areas at RISD that are 30 feet from a doorway would either put you into another doorway or in the middle of the street the implementation of this regulation on campus is less than perfect.  After several meetings with EHS, H.R., Facilities, Public Safety, students and others we arrived at the following as posted on RISD&#8217;s EHS Intranet website - <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/pdfs/SMOKE-FREE%20CAMPUS.pdf.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://intranet.risd.edu/pdfs/SMOKE-FREE%20CAMPUS.pdf.</a>  In addition to writing this policy we also posted the required RIDOH signs and because smoking is not allowed in entries we removed ashtrays in areas that they were present.  This is why ashtrays are not present where some people would like to see them installed &#8211; ashtray present must be o.k. to smoke.  To review the actual regulations go to this website - <a href=\"http://www.health.ri.gov/topics/smoking.php.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.health.ri.gov/topics/smoking.php.</a>  I think the litter situation is mostly for convenience, no ashtray present so the smoker snuffs it out on the sidewalk or street.  It is also partly due to not caring as evidenced by people throwing cigarettes butts out car windows rather than using the ashtray built into the car.  I also think smokers feel littering is a bit of an entitlement due to the fact that they are paying upwards of $6.00 a pack.  Lastly, to the person suggesting that they were considering taking up the habit, my advise is if you decide to smoke do it only for a short while, don&#8217;t make it a lifelong commitment otherwise your life probably won&#8217;t be very long.  Plus something very unattractive about wrinkles, bad breath, yellow teeth, lung cancer, heart disease, giving your hard earned dollars to the man, etc&#8230;.Just not cool!\n</p><p/></div>",

Keeping the walkways and sidewalks clear of garbage is within our control.

That entryway is going to look 100% better.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is a small thing, but it represents something bigger.  It seems to me that a lot of the students here on campus feel a sense of belonging to a community that strives to be environmentally conscientious.  In the recent quest to be more economically conscientious as a community, wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to look at small things that, in the long run, will help to make us a more economically and environmentally efficient school?

RISD does not want to condone smoking in areas where the RI Dept of Health restricts such activity, but the fact remains that people still smoke on the streets and throw their butts on the sidewalk when entering buildings, because we provide no alternative.  What if there were an ashcan at doorways, along with a sign that said something like &#8220;Smoking is prohibited within 30 feet of doors and windows to this building &#8212; please extinguish your cigarette here.&#8221;  That way, we clearly state our policy, provide an important reminder about health regulations, and provide a receptacle to reduce unsightly litter.</p>\n<p>And I admit to having laughed out loud at JB&#8217;s comment &#8212; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s meant to be taken seriously.

I guess what I meant to say is there is some part of the smoking population just as the non-smoking population that really doesn&#8217;t care about the environment, recycling, not littering, etc&#8230;Some smokers excuse might be, &#8220;Hey I&#8217;m paying $6.00 a pack I deserve to litter&#8221;, while the non-smoker rationalizes littering in a different way.  There are certainly many smokers that do not litter and do care about the environment.  I to am a former smoker quitting on Ground Hog day in 1980.  Why Ground Hog day?  No particular reason, but I remember it because I went to a Ground Hog Day party&#8230;.yeah a Ground Hog Day party and couldn&#8217;t smoke (most people at the party were smoking).  I admit to trying to be a bit provocative in my description of the effects of smoking as I really was hoping to start a serious dialog regarding this subject.  I hate to see people, particularly those that want to stop smoking addicted to cigarettes.  Myself I was what I would refer to as a guilty smoker, never fully enjoying cigarettes because I knew they were bad for me.  Other smokers can get over that and not really feel guilt about it.\n</p><p/></div>",

When we wrote the program back in the beginning of 2005 I strongly supported introducing the policy in tandem with a smoking cessation program.  At that time we were focusing on student smoking so the nurse educator Susan Rappaneau took on some activities to support students that wanted to quit smoking.  To your point, I think H.R. might consider taking on a smoking cessation program under their wellness initiative.\n</p><p/></div>",

Not bad. However you might feel about cigarettes, if we don&#8217;t offer a receptacle, the butts will end up on the ground. Pure n simple. There are certainly any number of possible ashtray designs, existing, and still to be invented, but it might be as simple as buying a few of these for the primary smoking areas. I remember in the bad old good old days as a college student (who smoked)&#8211; I was conscientious about a lot of thing (politics, war, peace, Virginia Woolf), but honestly, I don&#8217;t recall giving much thought to the butt ends of my cigarettes. These are different times. Students are a lot more considerate and a lot more aware. But lets make it a little easier to keep things clean. Offering an ashtray seems like a pretty obvious choice. It doesn&#8217;t encourage smoking to offer a place to put your butts any more than offering contraception or clean needles encourages unsafe sex or heroin addicition (for example).  <img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"/>  lucy\n</p><p/></div>",

What if a sense of togetherness was initiated through the already existing strengths of RISD students. Such as encouraging large - group - cross disciplinary - collaborative study-  classes which engage students in a deeper sense, instead of forming clubs that divert and distract from our passions, take the best of what we have, the passion we have for our art and our studio classes and move through this already existing creative force, but merge it into a larger collaborative initiative between departments.

Everyone here is capable of such creativity and innovation that can be applied to more than just homework assignments. Everything we students face at the present and in the future can be tackled like a design problem. We&#8217;re good at solving problems! Don&#8217;t think of Student Alliance as something completely separate from your studio and work- part of being an artist is engaging your peers and your community. Our meetings are similar to critiques. We all look at ideas, concerns, or problems and everyone gives their feedback in turn. We, as creative thinkers, can accomplish a lot in this environment.</p>\n<p>Nothing is immovable. Now is the time to rethink, change, and amend. The campus is going through a shift at the moment. Students are the main ingredient at RISD and students have to lead the way in the discussion about where RISD&#8217;s at and where it&#8217;s going. Just as John put it, what we make of it is what it will become. We cannot afford to have a fractured and scattered voice. Student Alliance is a great platform for the students to react to what&#8217;s happening around campus in a unified and consistent manner.</p>\n<p>Ruth, you introduce yourself as a &#8220;non student-alliance-member&#8221;. All students are automatically members. All I ask is that you give it a chance. I understand where you&#8217;re coming from, but as Sara said, we have addressed many of the things you mention. Maybe there are reasons behind why you think Student Alliance is ineffective or inefficient and I invite you to share them with us. As I said before, nothing is immovable. If students see a better way to do something then by all means let&#8217;s do it.</p>\n<p>Here we are being empowered by the president of the school to take a role in the shaping of RISD. It is so extremely valuable to have a voice and to know it is being heard. Who knows how many schools around the country don&#8217;t value the student voice, I would guess quite a few. The recent student protest &#8220;Take back NYU&#8221; in new york is telling that we can count ourselves among the fortunate. This is a pretty small school comparatively which means one student can go a long way.</p>\n<p>So, as all students are members of student alliance, I don&#8217;t need to invite you. But I will encourage you to come and be heard. Even if the thought has never crossed your mind to attend, the door is always open- to all students. If you can&#8217;t make it to the meeting, every department on campus has representatives. Talk to them. If you see me around campus (Tall, reddish hair, usually looking like I&#8217;m in a hurry) stop me to talk if you have an idea or want to hear what Student Alliance is doing. I&#8217;m always open to what fellow students are thinking.</p>\n<p>We are all RISD students and we are all in the same boat. None of us have spare time, but we can make time. Talk to one another, share ideas, collaborate. Take advantage of the community we have here. Every students opinion is valuable. Every voice. </p>\n<p>Thanks, John. Thanks all who&#8217;ve commented.</p>\n<p> See you Wednesday at the SA meeting!\n</p><p/></div>",

Whether we all do need to speak, whether all students should be actively involved in the manner that Student Alliance affords. We are all very different. </p>\n<p>What do all these terms mean:  &#8220;Engagement is the opposite of Isolation&#8221;, &#8220;Our RISD&#8221;, &#8220;Nothing is immovable&#8221;</p>\n<p>What is isolation, and what is engagement, are they in fact opposites or somehow more interdependent. Perhaps there are individuals that thrive on a greater degree of self-contemplation and isolation and others that thrive through outspoken engagement and perhaps both are equally essential as members of the larger community in balance. Perhaps engagement can be very isolating and isolation very engaging.</p>\n<p>What does it mean for RISD to be ours. Although well intended, does this imply a sort of ownership? Do we as students own RISD and in what sense, similar to renting a home we come to love? &#8230; so that as we pass through, RISD changes us as we change it? Then, perhaps it owns us more than we own it. In this sense RISD becomes inherent in us. Or, perhaps instead of the term &#8220;own&#8221;.  It shapes us as we shape it.  Perhaps we are more like wind forming a rock, shaping RISD in a multifaceted way to better able ourselves and future students to engage our world; and as we pass, it guides our future direction.</p>\n<p>And I noticed there have been a number of posts that I missed on two.risd  on interdisciplinary issues, very interesting. I read the minutes to your last meeting and noticed that student alliance also addressed the issue of the male\\female ratio of students, that&#8217;s really great, as well as graduation location concerns- very important.

I am reminded of Prof. Gareth Jones&#8217; recent charge to his undergrads in Foundation Studies of &#8220;Making Questions&#8221; &#8212; it is something that our culture at RISD has always done, and now we&#8217;re asking them out loud in all kinds of spaces like the Student Alliance meetings, at exhibition openings, on The Daily Jolt, within Facebook groups, and in other forums like this one here. Through great questions we eventually can find great answers to not only questions that RISD faces, but for our entire world as well. Your voice is being heard, and by the same token the voices in America are being heard today (I wrote about this <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/09/30/we-together-are-the-indomitable-strength/\" rel=\"nofollow\">in September in regards to the election</a>). </p>\n<p>When I was an undergraduate at MIT, I felt isolated. And as a faculty person at MIT, I felt isolated even more so. And then one day I realized that the isolation I felt was because I wasn&#8217;t making the effort to reach outwards. I was waiting for the system around me to pull me in. It never did. And I would ask myself, &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8230; and then one day I realized it was because *I* wasn&#8217;t doing anything about it. So I began to <i>engage</i> the community &#8212; became actively involved in the community at MIT. It is all a choice and a preference &#8212; as you rightly point out. I&#8217;d like to let students know that the choice is available to all of you. Not just while you are at RISD, but even after you graduate from RISD as well you all choose how you wish to <i>engage</i> the world. </p>\n<p>The art that you create, the designs that you set forth into production, the papers you publish, the people you inspire &#8212; the core of all those great activities come from within the isolation of your own mind. And the impact is inevitably tied to how your actions engage your respective communities. This is something that I only realized in my late 20s that I wish to impart on students earlier rather than later &#8212; as nobody told me these things and I know I could have benefited by knowing sooner. </p>\n<p>There is a wonderful story about how my friend Jacqueline Novogratz came to form her <a href=\"http://www.acumenfund.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acumen Fund</a> &#8212; an important initiative to solve global poverty. She tells a story of how she grew up in a normal, middle class suburban family, and how she had this blue sweater she always wore. Until one day she was made fun of at school, and had it donated to Goodwill and thought nothing of it thereafter. A few decades later, Novogratz found herself jogging in Kenya while on a global health initiative mission there, only to see a little boy walking by her wearing what she knew was her own blue sweater! She chased after the boy (in a nice way of course) to find that indeed sewed into the back of the sweater was her own name. It was her sweater from childhood. Somehow it had made the trek all the way around the world, and over many years, to let her know that every small act of engaging the world *does* and *can* make a difference. It&#8217;s a powerful story of how engagement matters, even when you least expect it.</p>\n<p>So, your message in this forum does matter. Your president heard it, and is moved. Every student can find their own way of engagement &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to happen at or through a Student Alliance meeting as you point out. Our nation is a country of choices &#8212; freedom to choose. Thank you for expressing that freedom, and for your inspiration today.</p>\n<p>Today I am spending <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2009/02/25/daddy-where-does-art-come-from/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the morning drawing</a> with my younger children &#8212; it is an activity that always inspires me. All of the work that the Students do in the studios and in their living groups inspires all of us here. That work makes a *big* difference and is what defines our unique culture here at RISD. You Students are what makes us all better people here at RISD. So thank you, and keep on creating, imagining, expressing, and inventing how our world will be. -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>This discussion along with John&#8217;s brief mention of drawing with his kids reminds me of the last time I was drawing with my three year old nephew.  When I got out the markers, crayons and paper and suggested we draw he said &#8216;no,&#8217; only to wander off into another dimension.  So I left everything out and about an hour later I came back to find him alone at the table eagerly &#8220;making,&#8221; as he calls it.  So he didn&#8217;t want to draw when I suggested it, but by leaving all the materials out I inadvertently created an open platform for him to &#8220;make&#8221; whenever he was comfortable doing so.  His creations were of course hung on the refrigerator for everyone in the family to ponder and appreciate without regard to when or where they were made.</p>\n<p>I mention this story merely as a commentary on the beneficial relationship I see between the Student Alliance and two.risd.  Ideas and issues raised in either case can in fact get a spot on the &#8220;RISD fridge&#8221; for our big family to ponder and appreciate.  If you have something you&#8217;re passionate about and can&#8217;t come to a SA meeting for whatever the reason, fortunately we have dept. reps all over campus, but we also now have this open forum to talk about it whenever you do have the time.  As I think JM was alluding to at the start of this thread, one is not a replacement of the other, but rather one can indeed compliment the other.</p>\n<p>As someone with the time management skills of a three-year-old, I just wanted to say that I will try to attend some SA meetings, but I really do appreciate the alternative opportunities for engagement that two.risd provides.\n</p><p/></div>",

(http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101360253 )    He mentioned Harvard&#8217;s loss in its endowment in the context of the current economic crisis. He indicated, surprisingly, that now would actually be a good time to take money out of an endowment including principle to invest in things, such as building labs etc to secure a better position when things improve.   Makes my head spin but does put into question the logic of guarding RISD&#8217;s endowment so jealously and simultaneously contributing to the employment lines.  Mr Johnston now works for the Sloan Institute at MIT.  With all due respect, maybe a call over there to chat might help RISD sort its priorities out.\n</p><p/></div>",

Actions and doing physical things are a more universal language of this community verses blogging. Those here that are delineating the issues are not communicating with those not making these same paths (going to look at the blog, reading the blog&#8230;etc.). We are in a physical discipline and we need to be more primitive in our organization to include people who don&#8217;t spend time here. These ideas are not being expressed in an effective medium anymore. So I believe the challenge is becoming more physically expressive. Spaces around campus are compartmentalized and separated by city. One solution is to create something to reach to those spaces (more mobile). Another solution is one that has been on the RISD drawing table before: community space. Although the new museum is nice, it reads inaccessible to developing or grass-roots forums. It is not a place for people who do not have everything figured out to wash-around for solutions. Something more studio-like is better. Inviting to the process instead of the product.\n</p><p/></div>",

The symposium will be open to all faculty, student and alumnae of RISD, as well as to the general public.  What policy dictates that absolutely no response from the Museum adminstration has been forthcoming? If nothing else, common courtesy would go a long way in contributing to community civility.</p></div>",

I had a similar experience with the booking of the Metcalf Auditorium and I assumed it was because it is a new space on campus and procedures were not in place.  Since I schedule many spaces on campus, I took the initiative and called the Museum and found out that Pam Kimel was able to help me out with this matter although it still isn&#8217;t clear who is responsible for communicating what needs to be done when booking this space.  I was told by media resources that I needed to speak with Cass his ext. 8405 to arrange my technical needs.</p>\n<p>The only concern I still have is that I was told a museum guard needs to be present for any event that is scheduled after hours, such as a lecture,  and the museum will charge the department that is scheduling the space $200.00 for this service.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame that this charge will deter people from booking this space as it is such a beautiful auditorium.\n</p><p/></div>",

If you are a Student with a g.risd account you can immediately start building a Website by clicking on the upper left corner on &#8220;Sites&#8221; &#8212; here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.schoolinfo.ca/connectingeducation/googleSites.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a starter tutorial</a> used in the California public schools. </p>\n<p>For many years the <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Media Lab</a> (where I came from) tried to institutionalize a way for websites to live within the media.mit.edu domain. It simply didn&#8217;t work because times change so quickly, so by the time that a solution is institutionalized the world has moved on. Students and Faculty simply made their own websites elsewhere and off of mit.edu and still do. The world is becoming distributed in this fashion &#8212; and what it means to be &#8220;an institution&#8221; is transforming in our century. </p>\n<p>And as I mentioned in a recent posting, the easiest way to build your own searchable (*important*) website right now is to simply use <a href=\"www.posterous.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.posterous.com</a> and its absolutely free. (Note that posterous makes it easy for you to map a &#8220;mynameishenry.com&#8221; to the actual Posterous site). Another great one is <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a>. One no longer needs to wait to make things happen. It&#8217;s all out there.</p>\n<p>-JM\n</p><p/></div>",

They make me smile.</p>\n<p>As a child of the 90s, i have benefitted, perhaps disproportionately, from Free Software (to the point that i selfishly expect a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free</a> solution to most problems i encounter). As someone that knowingly shells out fat wads of cash money for a mac, i love things that &#8216;look good&#8217; as well.</p>\n<p>The only thing, however, is that i have spent (by my estimation) a completely proportional amount of time <em>learning</em> how to use the free goodness provided me by the all knowing internet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, i have given up on the idealized notion that the web must be perfect, i&#8217;ve instead adopted a <strong>wabi-sabi</strong> philosophy to help me deal with <em>my</em> imperfect webpage (and its reliance on flickr and so forth). The web doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect, webpages change relatively quickly and hardly anybody here remembers (for example: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/19961112181513/http://www.nytimes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">nytimes.com in 1996</a>) What a ways we&#8217;ve come.</p>\n<p>The thing that i am startled by, though, is the miniscule valuation that is placed on actual (web) design work in comparison with, say, furniture, photography or metalsmithing. I posit to you:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would like a class ring / bookcase / poster / vase / etc. It must look good, but be customized to my specifications. I do not want to spend much time crafting this (a few minutes would be best!), so if there is a premade, customized solution available, that would be ideal.  Also, it should also be free. </p></blockquote>\n<p>You would laugh at me. Seriously. You would laugh, or run me out of your studio.</p>\n<p>Maybe, you would take pity on my na&#239;vite and suggest a few books in the library that i could look at (or better yet, an <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructable</a>). You might admonish me saying, &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to be right the first try, but if you keep trying, it&#8217;ll be good and you&#8217;ll be proud of how far you&#8217;ve come.&#8221; That would be nice.</p>\n<p>John&#8217;s resources are great, by the way. I also recommend <a href=\"http://webmonkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">webmonkey.com</a> because it&#8217;s how i learned many moons ago. It just takes some time and desire. The great thing about the web is that almost all of it can be free to you (all the tools are: c.f. smultron, text wrangler, php, apache, etc) but it requires your time, which is probably valuable to you. An old friend of mine, <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/xml_gal_manual.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">philip guo</a> made a freely available xml photo gallery, but it&#8217;s not without its opportunity cost.</p>\n<p>Part of this is really about <em>getting real.</em> Accept it. Worse is sometimes (lamentably) better; you can&#8217;t get something for nothing; good design takes time; etc. The <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">resources</a> <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/DEFAULT.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">are</a> <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/learn/html/\" rel=\"nofollow\">out</a> <a href=\"http://risd.generic.cx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a> (even if incomplete at times), but you have to be willing to invest something.</p>\n<p>&#8211;marcos\n</p><p/></div>",

(currently I think Miguel is the record holder of posts &#8230;).</i></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to several RISD supporters that have all noted the challenges of managing the schedules of their classes together with their targeted concentrations. Scheduling is the real core logistical question for all universities/colleges/schools out there. There are limited numbers of classrooms, schedules specific to teaching loads, and a variety of other factors that come into play for making a degree schedule an unnecessarily complex system to navigate. </p>\n<p>Schools that have advanced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning\">&#8220;ERPs&#8221;</a> (Enterprise Resource Planners) are gradually using analytics to figure out &#8220;optimal&#8221; balances of courses based upon all the possible student needs and requirements. RISD&#8217;s technology infrastructure is quite old actually, and to change it would cause a gazillion dollars (10M or so) and also to retrain the Staff to work under an ERP would take around a couple of years. For instance when MIT introduced the infamous <a href=\"http://www.sap.com\">SAP</a> about a while back, we came to an entire halt as an organization &#8212; it was really really bad medicine. Suffice it to say, RISD&#8217;s not in a position right now to make the jump to warp speed on the backoffice software front. But it&#8217;s always useful to think aloud. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, the question remains of how to manage the complex task of scheduling in a way that is beneficial to Students and Faculty and leverages RISD&#8217;s facility resources in the most optimal way. A few weeks back on the street I met the wonderful person in the Registrar&#8217;s organization that faces the yearly task of making the entire puzzle of possibilities fit. It&#8217;s much like trying to land hundreds of airplanes at the same time (like being an air traffic controller at O&#8217;Hare). And just like an airport, it&#8217;s often an impossible task to keep all the passengers happy. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a problem I&#8217;m aware of, and am on the look out for how to find a saner path. If we all think together to find constructive solutions to the issue I believe anything is possible. RISD <i>can</i>.</p></div>",

Are trustees invited to return as trustees each year or are they grandfathered into the  board? Like at MIT, are recent alums voted into the board/corporation every few years?</p>\n<p>The corporation analogy is somewhat rough, but it&#8217;s one of the only other entities that i know of that operates in a similar capacity.

Under <a href=\"http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE7/7-6/7-6-22.HTM\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhode Island law</a>, the &#8220;job&#8221; of a trustee is to &#8220;manage&#8221; the &#8220;affairs&#8221; of the corporation &#8220;(1) In good faith; (2) With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a similar position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) In a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <i>general</i>, our trustees are elected to three-year terms, with a limit of two consecutive terms and a &#8220;lifetime&#8221; limit of four terms.

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Sarah,</p>\n<p>While a pass/fail system may work for some institutions, I&#8217;m not sure if it would be a practical solution here. The reason why I say this, is, as a student here now and as someone who has taught in the past, it&#8217;s important to know one&#8217;s level of progression. With a pass/fail scenario, it seems like you could do mediocre work and still &#8220;pass&#8221; without truly getting an understanding of how far you developed in a project or in your work. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit, a &#8220;Grade&#8221; system is also not perfect, by any means, by at it&#8217;s basic core it allows you as an artist and designer to understand your level of progression and where you stand in a very competitive world.</p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s philosophy is to explore the world through the liberal arts and expand upon knowledge is, for the most part, a self-guided journey through academia. People go to Brown to immerse themselves in an academic environment that allows for that exploration. With RISD, one specifically comes here to learn the in and outs of the art and design world, and how to better, if not perfect their craft, skill, and technique. Seeing and measuring the progression in your work is a vitally important aspect to your overall growth as an artist and designer. What we do here is not easy, by any means, and i think having some sort of measure of your progression should be soon as more of a tool, a concrete way for faculty to communicate with a students about their level of development in comprehension. Of course, at times, we may disagree with our faculty members in the manner in which we have developed, and their are avenues in which to contest such matters, but overall, the faculty is the reason why we&#8217;re here&#8212; to pick up and learn their techniques and approach, and have their teachings become a part of our own unique style. Afterall, if we were already perfect at what we do, we wouldn&#8217;t need to go to art school <img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"/></p>\n<p>just my thoughts&#8230;\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>While I agree with some of what Eric is saying, I too think pass-fail would be overall more beneficial to students at RISD (or at least the option of it).</p>\n<p>I would argue that while it might make some students only produce mediocre work, at the same time it would probably encourage a lot of students to think outside of the normal parameters. I think a lot of students think to themselves &#8220;how can I get an A on this assignment?&#8221; rather than exploring a new idea, or experimenting in a new medium. Many students might play it safe because they are worried about getting a good grade. RISD isn&#8217;t a place where students have to worry about playing things safe in order to achieve high marks. Make mistakes now, because once you graduate you can&#8217;t afford to make as many!</p>\n<p>If it were pass/fail students wouldn&#8217;t focus as much on &#8220;is this project/assignment A material&#8221; and could ask &#8220;did I progress at all? What can I take from this?&#8221;. Students wouldn&#8217;t be worried about individual projects failing, because often times you learn most when your project fails. All too often I see my peers putting work up on the walls that I would consider &#8220;safe&#8221;. That is, they know how to use one medium really well, or how to render a specific subject very well- so rather than finding new, innovative ways to solve design problems, they stick with what they know so that they get an A.</p>\n<p>Some professors can see through it, sure, but most of the time getting grades IS a surprise. Even if you feel like you&#8217;ve grown a lot as an artist or designer, seeing the grade could change ones attitude about the perceived progress. </p>\n<p>Also, it would be putting more trust in the students. As Eric put it, the experience at brown is &#8220;a self-guided journey through academia&#8221;. Brown trusts their students with their own education. I think RISD could put more trust in students to pursue their interests. It&#8217;s obvious that RISD students cannot be separated from their work, taking away a &#8220;grade&#8221; system wouldn&#8217;t stop us from doing great work. Especially Juniors and Seniors who have built their skills and are ready to pursue a more self-guided curriculum.</p>\n<p>If someone isn&#8217;t doing work, not coming to class on time, missing class, not participating, or showing no interest in the class then they shouldn&#8217;t be passing anyway. The students are investing in an education, if they don&#8217;t care enough to put effort into what they are doing here then it&#8217;s their own fault if the don&#8217;t pass. Students should be trusted to make decisions, with the advisory of faculty, staff, and administrators, about the education their families are investing in.\n</p><p/></div>",

It is tough to appease the department and worry about grades, no one <b> ever</b> gets an &#8216;A&#8217;. If we had the opportunity to take a course pass fail then we would be able to learn from the instructor, but not be afraid to do work that we want to do, rather than what we think we are suppose to do for the department. I think this is also particularly pertinent for a senior project, or thesis. We should be able to own our work and not feel that it is somehow inadequate because of strange pedagogical differences.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>It&#8217;s funny, some folks really <em>really</em> care about grades. some do not. Here&#8217;s a better put example from <a href=\"http://objectsinspaceandtime.com/~/fish/sb/2006/06/advice_for_incoming_risd_gd_gr.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog</a>. You can substitute the word &#8216;grade&#8217; in there wherever it makes sense:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nat almost every crit there is a winner and a loser. if you don&#8217;t like competition and you think we should all just get along and collaborate and all that, well hey. but the truth is that there is almost always someone who is way out front of everyone else in the crit, be it in terms of content, concept, execution, whatever. it&#8217;s not always fair. some people &#8220;win&#8221; by just producing way more than anyone else and not editing their shit down. everyone else in the class, besides the &#8220;winner&#8221;, will be at more or less the same level, except the &#8220;loser&#8221;. this person maybe didn&#8217;t understand the project, or they technically fucked up their work somehow, or maybe they&#8217;re just an imbecile. </p>\n<p>the arc of most classes has this same pattern, typically with the person who &#8220;wins&#8221; the most crits &#8220;winning&#8221; the class. it seems to be like RISD de rigeur to give one person an A, the rest B&#8217;s, and one person a C or F in like every class. I don&#8217;t know if all the teachers got together and decided this one day, or if the situation just happened to converge on that pattern, but there it is. </p>\n<p>if you know in your heart that you are a good designer, you won&#8217;t care about &#8220;winning&#8221; or &#8220;losing&#8221;, but it can be quite fun and stimulating to engage in hearty interclass competition, and it makes you think about your work in a different way. you&#8217;re all still friends at the end of the day, and you all still go for beers at the end of the week&#8230; &#8220;losers&#8221; get gossiped about, and &#8220;winners&#8221; get secretly lauded, but that&#8217;s the extent of things really.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What i&#8217;m trying to say is that last part: <em>if you know in your heart that you are a good [whatever], you won&#8217;t care about &#8220;winning&#8221; or &#8220;losing&#8221;</em>. Sometimes you have off days, sometimes you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you prioritize a class, sometimes you prioritize not burning out. These things happen; life happens, and it goes on. In some sense, you can think of grades as a way of measuring how &#8216;on top of it&#8217; you are; how organized you have remained, how focused you are and how well you manage your multiple classes. In most cases, grades are ultimately a metric of how well you are able to earn a grade, which has some dubious quality in itself. Some other times, they are a reflection on your own actual in-class effort. It varies.</p>\n<p>I have noticed that in many cases, courses have some fantastically lenient metrics for grades, tending to emphasize (from day one) administrative and legitimately quantitative details: i.e. attendance, preparation for discussion, participation, timeliness of work, etc. These are usually very attainable goals, usually with little effort from most students beyond the baseline requirements. </p>\n<p>You may argue that removing grades removes the incentive to perform, giving everyone the chance to just <em>coast on by</em>. Perhaps. Having taught, i can tell you that even grades cannot motivate the unmotivated. Sometimes, having no grades makes a class less stressful (i.e. my freshman physics class) or can inspire lack of dedication (my chemistry class). There is no guarantee of either, as this attitude is often fostered by healthy competition (or lack thereof) already present in the group of people taking the class and their level of academic and emotional investment.</p>\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, i noticed as a freshly minted (tech) graduate that there were roughly two types of employers. The first hired students using gpa as a metric and included a spot for it on the internship applications. These were very prestigious companies and corporate research groups that used grades as a way of measuring, best as i can tell, sticktoitiveness. I was told by one that my grades were the only way of measuring my progress up to that point. As someone that had really at that point started &#8216;figuring out school&#8217; by the time it was too late, i wasn&#8217;t all that sure.</p>\n<p>The other companies (usually smaller, startups, and &#8217;boutique&#8217; firms) never looked at grades unless you actually put it on your resume. These companies, for better or worse, based some part of your evaluation on a) if you could get along with them and b) if you actually knew what you were talking about in a casual interview and c) if you were actually excited about their product. If you had good grades and met the above, then all the power to you. If you still fit their small checklist  for employeeship, then you still got the job. Funny, right? In deciding which of two employees to hire, the smaller firm would often choose the one they could get along with, unsurprisingly enough considering the long hours endemic to young companies.</p>\n<p>The funny thing, though, is that everyone at risd might as well already be pass/fail. </p>\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s going to ask for your transcript or gpa unless you apply to grad school, and even then, your essay and your portfolio will likely hold greater sway. For those graphic designers at the &#8216;reality check portfolio review&#8217; today, perhaps you can tell me how many prospective employers asked for your cumulative and major gpa. In all likelihood, they looked at your portfolio and thought for a bit how your work fit in with theirs and then they probably spent some amount of time trying to get to know you and gauging your level of interest in the company. Smells like pass/fail to me.</p>\n<p>&#8211;marcos\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello all,</p>\n<p>Whereas I am not the best one to speak of the history of the pass/fail grade legacy here at RISD, it&#8217;s my understanding that it was in the late 70&#8217;s or early 80&#8217;s that the grade system was reinstated. It had to do with accreditation. I don&#8217;t know how many years the pass/fail system was in effect. However, written evaluations that each faculty fill out at the semester&#8217;s end are a left-over from that time where it was the only tangible receipt of a faculty comment, supporting the pass or fail.  When grades were brought back it was felt this form was helpful to students - and I agree it is. And so that part remains. </p>\n<p>What John and others note, grades are important for some situations - but those are very limited, and often viewed in grad school applications or the like. However, it&#8217;s all about what you do, and keeping at it. </p>\n<p>I remember reading of all the failures of <a href=\"http://www.prx.org/pieces/11893-this-i-believe-oscar-hammerstein-ii\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oscar Hammerstein</a>, and how it was only by persistence that he brought forth some of our most beloved musicals, collaborating over and over again.

In past, i&#8217;ve heard faculty talk about the increase in admissions when the economy tanks. So what i&#8217;m wondering is, how does this compare to risd? are admissions down or up these days? Is it harder to find (or keep) good students, or is this a problem that risd is most insulated from because it occupies a relatively small pond?</p>\n<p>happy reading!<br/>\n&#8211;marcos</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Marcos,</p>\n<p>The NY Times article you mentioned above (3/8) captures the uncertainty that many Admissions people are feeling in colleges around the country right now. The unprecedented upheaval in our financial worlds, from the largest institutions to individual families, is making it much more uncertain than normal to predict what road students will follow with their college choices in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>It seems this year that many private colleges (more expensive) have seen declines in their applicant pools while most public institutions (less expensive) are experiencing increases. At RISD, our freshman applicant pool this year is currently 2817 students; last year at this time it was 3149 (a record number) and before that it was 2764 for 2007 and 2553 for 2006. So, this year we are down vs last, like most privates, but have our second highest number of freshman apps.</p>\n<p>For graduate applicants, we&#8217;ve experienced a significant increase this year. We now have 2145 applicants versus 1676 last year and 1724 and 1721 in the two prior years. It seems many people see this time of diminished job options as their moment to pursue new educational opportunities.</p>\n<p>We are hoping that the excellent education offered at RISD will continue to assure admitted students and their families that the significant investment of effort and personal resources is well worth it. We are pretty certain, however, that reaching a decision to attend a more-expensive private college will be particularly hard for many students this time around and will continue to be a major, and growing, factor in college choice in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Ed Newhall<br/>\nDirector of Admissions</p>\n<p/></div>",

BRAVO!<br/>\nI do have an issue with the publicity, however. I see these large, black, mostly opaque, posters all over campus on the glass office doors and I find them problematic for several reasons. First, we did have an agreement that student activity posters not be posted on the front doors of our offices. The front doors of the Administrative areas are still our front doors. They offer a clear view into and out of our office &#8220;homes&#8221;. They serve the function of making us visible to each other. It&#8217;s is about ease and comfort of access. These posters block windows, create a feeling of being closed in or off, and especially they take priority over the identity of the office and the work done there. Do they really need to be so intrusive? It also raises questions for future poster location. Can any student group do this? If so, what happens then? If not, what are the criteria?<br/>\nI am clearly supportive of the project, but why does the publicity have to dominate our attention in this particular way?\n</p><p/></div>",

This distinction can also be articulated inversely: principally Architecture, Illustration, Industrial Design and Graphic Design students have proposed programming.</p>\n<p>At a surface level, I do not think for one second that this implies a lack of &#8220;activity&#8221; from these unrepresented majors. Much of it may have to do with the varying populations of different majors. If Aaron&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/aperryz/3326166285/\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;space pairings&#8221; diagram</a> accurately reflects department sizes, statistically, larger majors are more likely to yield a greater number of proposals.</p>\n<p>But I also think that the very orchestration and structuring of the &#8220;What We Do&#8221; project&#8211;even in its respectable aim for communication, transparency and sharing&#8211;in a way, limits many forms of enunciation, either because of situation or format. What does it mean to create space of conviviality and communication that is sited, that has boundaries? While we are ostensibly free to do &#8220;what we do&#8221; on a day to day basis, what does it mean to articulate it in a sanctioned context, with all due acknowledgement of this articulation being &#8216;heard&#8217;?</p>\n<p>I do not have answers to these questions, nor do I expect them to be provided. While I admire efforts to open up the possibility of new connections between departments and students, I wonder if there are other more open and informal ways of doing this: promoting exchange and experimentation but still acknowledging feelings that we are not all on the same boat, and not all in this together.\n</p><p/></div>",

But the perennial problem at RISD has been institutional barriers to this collaboration. With What We Do, we&#8217;re trying our best using the methods we know and are confident in to bring people together with the simplest and most open form that will ensure a moderate to major level of participation. This effort can only be extended so far by us mere individuals; for this thing to really work, everyone needs to get on board, and in so doing will hopefully overcome the mindset of barriers that the institution has engendered. We have been seeking help, input, support and participation from every department and group on campus since this thing got off the ground and are continually seeking input to ensure that the day&#8217;s events happen in a way that everyone in the community can benefit from. </p>\n<p>Thanks for the questions, they are good to keep in mind.

Printers from Konica-Minolta, Cannon, HP and Xerox were all evaluated based on quality, price, cost per print, and maintainability.</p>\n<p>I am pleased to report the results of our evaluation: Xerox was the clear winner on all fronts. As a result we have acquired a Xerox color printer for test purposes &#8212; a Xerox 7760DN color laser printer is now installed in the AMC Lab (2nd fl. Design Center). We will be offering this printer in an evaluation mode at the following price points:</p>\n<p>*Letter single Side - $.75</p>\n<p>*Letter Duplex - $1.00</p>\n<p>*Tabloid Single - $1.00</p>\n<p>*Tabloid Duplex -$1.25</p>\n<p>We are also reviewing our entire Xerox color printer fleet to determine if, in fact, a lower per print charge can be maintained going forward. Based on our initial review, I feel confident that the price per print on all color laser printers can be reduced. Our research should be concluded over the next few weeks at which point I will publish our new pricing scheme. Obviously, this new printer utilizes the latest print technology and is much more efficient, thus resulting in the lower cost per page. Please stay tuned.</p>\n<p>If our testing of this new Xerox 7760DN printer is successful, we are planning to install three such printers in the following locations:  AMC, BEB and CIT.  Please feel free to comment on the quality of the printer, as your feedback will be an essential part of the printer evaluation process.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nRalph</p></div>",

It certainly gave me pause, and I was wondering what Students might think about it. <i>Does this accurately depict your generation?</i> The YouTube discussion strand is quite active and going in all chaotic directions. Although the video is overdramatic and missing key issues core to the essence of our visual liberal arts education here at RISD, I&#8217;m curious to hear what resonates and what doesn&#8217;t with your generation. My gut feeling is that it shows how the more experiential approach here at RISD is what sets it apart from other forms of more <i>passive</i> educational norms. Thanks, -JM</p></div>",

When will people realize that the hardest thing to do these days is focus all your energy and thoughts on just one thing?</p>\n<p>With the technology available today, my biggest daily activity is tied to the feeling that I need to be aware.  Countless blogs, including this one, newest runway shows for class research, news websites, e-mail, friends, family.  All of these things are available online and I&#8217;ve been taught that I should be aware of them.  It is my responsibility to keep myself up to date, and as technology gets faster, up to date becomes up to the second.  I can remember back in middle school being taught to get in the habit of checking my e-mail once a day.  Now, not only do I have a mobile phone that checks for me every minute, but checking once a day seems nearly impossible and somewhat lazy.  Having the world at your fingertips is a great feeling, but it is also a big undertaking.  Students today are in a weird place where so much is happening around them, and they not only have unprecedented access to information about it all, but they are somewhat expected to absorb it at a near-constant rate.</p>\n<p>What is great about risd that I think differs us from this more general analysis, is that, through our art, we are allowed a bit more freedom to react to all that we are experiencing outside the classroom.  So much of the experience in a studio class relies on what each student brings to the table.  Whereas, sitting in a giant lecture hall listening to your prof yell about something you were supposed to have read about in your $100 textbook really doesn&#8217;t invite exterior culture infiltration.  I definitely think New Media creates a challenge for us, as students.  But I think that challenge is a great gift to us, as artists and designers.\n</p><p/></div>",

In the larger lectures I attended many (but not all) laptops were either playing games or surfing the web.  At big universities like CU where only 50% of classes have less than 20 students (my PSYCH lecture had 600!), the potential for electronic distraction in class is staggering at best, but in no way merits such a plight of students as this video suggests; we&#8217;re not that helpless.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it gives the modern student enough credit in adapting to the &#8216;digital wonderland&#8217;  that we&#8217;ve been handed.  Its also not fair to lump the myriad of challenges our generation faces together and underscore it with unnecessarily melodramatic music.</p>\n<p>What this video fails to mention are some of the incredibly positive sides to the blogo/social networkingo/time-wasteosphere and its potential to compliment academia.  As the telecommunications author Clay Shirky points out, modern society has awakened to a kind of dangerous new &#8220;power of organizing without organizations,&#8221; which is to say that, by the 19th c. model, the tremendous amounts of time and effort previously needed to rally behind a common cause or subject are now being shattered by new technologies, and old institutions like universities and news media are scrambling because the rules of engagement have changed suddenly.  They are no longer the keepers of scarce information.  Of course the internet in all its greatness could never hope to replace the hands-on experiences of studying at RISD or any institution for that matter, but it can certainly compliment them.</p>\n<p>So rather than be pummeled by the massive wave of technology (and debt!) we are facing today my instinct is that our generation has already figured out that the wave can not only be ridden to safety, but also enjoyed.</p>\n<p>Went off topic a little, thanks for listening.\n</p><p/></div>",

The question for me remains why humanities classrooms at many colleges still operate as shown in the video, despite decades of proposals for innovations that would be taken for granted in most studio courses. What is making that change so hard at so many colleges? In what ways is it structural? Will the upcoming budget cuts cause retrenchment? Or permit new options to be suddenly viable? As a history teacher in a studio setting at RISD, it is my hope that ongoing conversations about interdisciplinary collaboration will continue to mean cross-pollinating how things are taught, as much as a focus on the &#8220;what&#8221;. Still, I think it is a mistake to unquestioningly assume the un-present teacher implied by the video is a happy camper who set out to teach a boring class. A solution will require the commitment of not only students and often part-time or junior faculty, but also those administrators and leaders who have the power to institutionalize change. One often-replaceable teacher can only do so much. To use my own experience as an example, each year that I have been asked to teach ID History to 70 students for one t.u., I struggle very hard with how to balance so many competing ideals with the reality of the situation I am handed. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn&#8217;t. We just have to keep trying.

Prince Ramus is the Principal of REX Architecture P.C. &#8211; the offshoot from OMA &#8211; the designers of the Seattle Public Library. Prince Ramus was a key individual on that project as well. The lecture was entitled &#8220;Agency&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Prince Ramus spoke passionately about architects&#8217; ability to alter types - he used the library type and his work in Seattle as an example, and elaborated on the relationship to flexibility in contemporary architecture.</p>\n<p>Flexibility is great in concept (imagine an abstract line). In actuality, there generally exists a gray zone by which differing options occur (imagine an abstract line but blurry). For example, chairs get moved around in an open space for different configurations. In a contemporary library, one that will reflect the ever-changing demands of our world, libraries need flexible space. The key point, according to Prince Ramus is for contemporary architecture (and by extension contemporary libraries), to have fields of pre-sets / &#8216;tools&#8217; by which flexibility can occur from (ie multiple abstract lines by which blurry-ness can occur from).</p>\n<p>Regarding the RISD Library, spatially, I would say we have a wonderfully ample amount of flexible space &#8211; the large open main floor, the stadium seating, and the top study area.<br/>\nPerhaps, we as a community can continue to think up many more &#8216;pre-sets&#8217; by which to use this space so that we may have a field of blurry abstract lines. It would allow our community to maximize the flexibility of the open space afforded to us by the project architects.</p>\n<p>Cheers!\n</p><p/></div>",

In a community of students that work harder than most (Brown students seem intimidated by how hard RISD students can work), I see the major challenge of finding ways to bring the student body together organically. But we keep on dreaming and trying. It&#8217;s important because the world is finding ways to come together as one. We live in unprecedented times for communication and community to achieve a higher level. -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>It&#8217;s hard to predict what will come in the future, but let me show you it visually as a diagram that helped me understand it better from <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_11/b4123026586146.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily\">an article</a> in BW. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a good marker to understand the health of the stock market. It fell from 14,165 in October 9, 2007 to 6,726 on March 3, 2009. If you think (hope) that the stock market recovers in a linear fashion, then you can see the following relationships:</p>\n<p>   1. If the market improves 6% each year, it will take roughly 13 years to get back to where we were a year ago.<br/>\n   2. If the market improves 8% each year, it will take roughly 10 years to get back.<br/>\n   3. If the market improves 10% each year (over-optimistic), it will take roughly 8 years to get back.</p>\n<p>Click on the diagram below to see it more clearly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/090322_stockmarket003.png\" title=\"090322_stockmarket003.png\"><img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/090322_stockmarket003.thumbnail.png\" alt=\"090322_stockmarket003.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p>So in short, if the market improves then our endowment will improve proportionately (there&#8217;s a year or two of lag before an endowment moves I understand). And while the market is down, we can certainly guess that the many families that send their children to RISD are experiencing new hardships. We are all connected to everything and everyone else. What is certain is that our definition of prosperity is undergoing a permanent change &#8212; 8 to 13 years feels permanent for us as we exist here in 2009. </p>\n<p>A friend sent me a link to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/opinion/22friedman.html?emc=eta1\">this NYT article</a> from today by Thomas Friedman. It frames our current challenge as a nation quite well. While many look to blame a specific person or series of events that got us here, the only real thing we should be doing is to get our collective act together to take on the future. </p>\n<p>When President Obama was taking to office earlier in the year, a well-connected friend was appointed to the new administration. Many of my other friends seemed jealous for her to have such an opportunity to serve our country and the new administration. To all of them I said, &#8220;If you live in the United States, we all work for the President. So you don&#8217;t have to go to Washington DC to serve in the ongoing initiative of transforming our nation.&#8221; What we do here at RISD matters. And it matters big. It has always mattered regardless of who our President is of our nation, or here at RISD for that matter.  </p>\n<p>Look to today&#8217;s <i>Providence Journal</i> and you would have seen <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/ECONOMIC_SOLUTIONS_03-22-09_P2DNH60_v366.2fcdf7d.html\">RISD squarely mentioned</a> as the key to turning around our city and state. What we do here changes the economic fate of Providence, Rhode Island, the USA, and the world. So let&#8217;s continue to work hard, think hard, dream hard, and be collectively determined to do the creative lifting, pulling, thinking that the world counts on us to demonstrate. Our outbound graduates are <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2009/03/18/portfolio-reviews-signal-success/\">counting on us</a> to keep their alma mater radiating the powerful RISD energy across the world. </p>\n<p>Thanks RISD. -JM</p></div>",

We are very conscious of the costs and have been paying close attention to our expenses while endeavoring to provide a wonderful celebratory day to those who are graduating and their families. </p>\n<p>Recently, families of graduating students received information about commencement weekend and the ceremony and graduating students have been notified that it is time to order their caps and gowns and will receive more information in their boxes when they return from spring break.</p>\n<p>For particular questions about the weekend, please contact Cecile Theroux in the student affairs office: <a href=\"mailto:ctheroux@risd.edu\">ctheroux@risd.edu</a></p>\n<p>Barbara Fienman<br/>\nInterim Associate Provost for Student Affairs\n</p><p/></div>",

For instance, in the Intro Animation class, we assess a lab fee to cover what we hand to the students the first day of class &#8212; a field guide, peg bar, packet of punched Animation bond paper, a USB Flash drive, etc.  Intro Film students get a Film editing kit, a few starter rolls of film, some processing.  Trust me, since we&#8217;re buying things in bulk, you get more materials via the lab fee than you&#8217;d be able to get buying the materials yourself.  And there are additional class costs that can be covered by the lab fee, such as field trips (our Senior Animation students travel annually to the Ottawa International Animation Festival, and the lab fee covers their accommodations and festival pass).\n</p><p/></div>",

Therefore, it was one of the first expenditures under consideration for cutting</p>\n<p>The vote Marcos referred to was just to take an informal barometer as to how the committee felt about spending the usual (we and ALL of the other surrounding colleges donate this every year around graduation) 10K to Waterfire OR donating a 5K &#8220;partial&#8221; donation instead siting economic difficulty. Peter, who is a very invaluable connection for RISD to the outside world as the head of Public Engagement, warned us that this would make a very bad impression on the whole of the community and with the other colleges that did put forth their 10K.</p>\n<p>Please trust that the committee did STRONGLY consider this as an area to cut costs, and may still.</p>\n<p>The committee, as well as members of the Student Alliance present at the meeting in conversation, generally related the sentiment that IF we put forward that 10K, we would take MORE ownership in that Waterfire (which WF is willing to do).</p>\n<p>Any ideas on how to do this from students would be VERY HELPFUL to the committee, and you can feel free to email me ideas.

I will make sure the committee considers putting any cost cutting towards soothing the $260. </p>\n<p>At the vary, vary least I will also look into a way of making usage of the $260 more transparent (I mean, I&#8217;d like to know to!).</p>\n<p>SO I will report back after the meeting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>And I would be remiss to not remind everyone that Student Alliance is the best place to raise these issues, hear what people are thinking, and/or generally complain for a good cause.</p>\n<p>I will be getting back to you all,</p>\n<p>Danny<br/><a href=\"mailto:dfloyd@g.risd.edu\">dfloyd@g.risd.edu</a>\n</p><p/></div>",

The whole event costs a lot more that $260 x 600 or so people graduating. Please don&#8217;t think that the school has put the entire cost of their own graduation on the students. Also know that the money is not being wasted; every possible cost is being reconsidered or event cut down.

I promised to bother them about getting it done. Barbara says that the blog isn&#8217;t really the place for exact itemized lists, and I agree. But she has opened her phone lines and email inbox to anyone who wants these figures, so go get them. <a href=\"mailto:bfienman@risd.edu\">bfienman@risd.edu</a></p>\n<p>One the second issue of Waterfire, we are going to be donating the usual $10K to Waterfire for our Commencement.

But I also have noticed that RISD&#8217;s reputation in the Providence community, is not always glowing. I don&#8217;t especially want to see my graduating class be the first (of any college in the area) to set a precedence of stand-off-ishness (which, honestly, RISD is accused of enough already).</p>\n<p>So I would like to see the students come up with idea&#8217;s of making this Waterfire an even that we will enjoy, because that&#8217;s very possible. </p>\n<p>(ANY STUDENT ALLIANCE DEPARTMENT REPS LISTENING HINT HINT)</p>\n<p>Ok so that&#8217;s the breakdown.

I think where she really struck a nerve and touched everyone in the room was when she explained the following:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu.&#8221; This translates from Zulu to mean a person is a person through other people.  This South African humanist philosophy is known as Ubuntu.  The essence of being human.  Archbishop Tutu says. &#8220;Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can&#8217;t exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. You can&#8217;t be human all by yourself&#8230;a person with Ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others are tortured or oppressed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since Claudia spoke immediately after Candace Baer and members of her staff addressed issues of concern regarding the current economic crisis and in particular how it will impact the staff at RISD, Claudia&#8217;s message, &#8220;Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can&#8217;t exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. . . .&#8221; emphasized our shared unity of concern for each member of our RISD community.</p>\n<p>These comments also reminded me of a recent discussion I had with someone about the importance of civility and of maintaining a positive attitude and helpful manner in all our dealings with each other in these difficult times. Civility equates to Ubuntu. It seems that the Zulu have embedded that message into their attitude and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>I hope that all of us can learn to practice Ubuntu not just here at RISD, but in all our interactions every day.</p>\n<p>We all know that there will be difficult days ahead as some members of our community leave us. However, let&#8217;s all practice Ubuntu and civility to the best of our ability and do our best to remember we are all sharing in an unsettled and stressful environment.</p></div>",

Maybe, I won&#8217;t speak for the whole artist race.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the artist race&#8230;</p>\n<p>This thread made me think of a book by Dennis Dutton  called THE ART INSTINCT that discusses how art is essential to, and perhaps defining of, our evolution into Homo sapiens as opposed to another species. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve only had time to hear a few interviews with him on the topic (It&#8217;s number two on my to-read-after-graduation list after THE YIDDISH POLICEMAN&#8217;S UNION). I will include links below. He argues that even at our most neanderthal stages, we had to create artistic fictions in order to take control over our world or to predict any outcome of situations. Also, our ability either make art or appreciate it has played an important role in our construction of SOCIETY, the only thing we have over animals with stronger muscles and sharper teeth. One lesson I take from this is that our abilty to make art and our abilty to design tools have a similar genetic history with different, but overlapping, evolutionary roles.</p>\n<p>SO this is to say, I think, that design and art coexist not only in the Bauhausistic way, but it happens on the level of our very DNA.</p>\n<p>I think this is a very uplifting sentiment for a place like this, where art or design may have different levels of importance to each individual. Think so?</p>\n<p>-Danny</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2009/03/art-and-evolution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPR&#8217;s On Point</a></p>\n<p>He was also on the <a href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/217078/january-28-2009/denis-dutton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colbert Report</a>, if you want a funnier, pithier version of his theories.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hi Danny, Your post reminded me of a talk I gave to the National Science Foundation about ten years ago. I was talking about the way that &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;engineering&#8221; are spoken about in schools of technology, was not so different than the way that &#8220;art&#8221; and &#8220;design&#8221; are spoken about in schools of expression. My point was that there is an important *difference* in these fields that can be divided along lines of &#8220;conceptual vs practical&#8221; or &#8220;abstract vs concrete&#8221; or &#8220;<insert viewpoint=\"\"> vs </insert><insert opposite-viewpoint=\"\">.&#8221; We can debate until the end of time whether the difference is constructive or destructive, or whether one is more useful than the other is use-less. But there is a simple fact that MIT excels because it has *both* engineering and science. And RISD excels because it has *both* design and art. The natural coexistence is an important *fact* of RISD &#8212; as you elegantly point out it is &#8220;in the DNA.&#8221;</insert></p>\n<p>As RISD&#8217;s president I know it&#8217;s important to represent *all* perspectives of RISD. This includes not just fine art and design, but the liberal arts as well. In addition, there is the foundational studies view and also the graduate view as well. All of these special &#8220;genes&#8221; add up to make the unique intellectual culture of RISD. </p>\n<p>In my career I&#8217;ve done a variety of things. I&#8217;ve designed for many corporations. I&#8217;ve also exhibited sculpture, abstract paintings, photographs in solo shows in Asia, Europe, and the US, as well as video, interactive installations, classical exhibitions, kinetic sculptures. There have been a variety of paths in life that have made me curious, and I have reacted to them by making things. In the design world I am seen as an artist; in the art world I am seen as a designer. This is the curse of living across many disciplines. But it is a choice that I have made consciously and without regret. </p>\n<p>I have seen so many things that matter in the world, and so many things that are completely meaningless. What differentiates whether something will have an impact has nothing to do with the field from which it originates. It is always the timeliness and significance &#8212; that which is maximally relevant at the right time. </p>\n<p>Art matters most when it it matters the most; design matters the most when it matters the most. We all take our turns at the bat for the world, and sometimes we hit a home run for civilization. Now is the right time for important work to be made regardless of the field that you represent. Batter up. Hit it out of the park RISD. -JM\n</p><p/>\n<p/></div>",

My experience has been that there are a large number of students who are (self-admittedly) helpless when it comes to Creative Suite software (not to mention HTML/CSS, and even sometimes desktop functions). Perhaps I&#8217;ve been corrupted by my own experience into believing that this kind of knowledge is more common than it is, but I do believe that today these are skills that are invaluable both in representing yourself and within the creative process as it becomes ever more computer-centric. It is strange that an art community like RISD, which I imagine would be an &#8216;avante garde&#8217; in exploring these media) seems late in adopting; the division between those who are keen on constructing with digits and those that are into digital construction being very pronounced (at least from my vantage point).</p>\n<p>I know that there are some freshman foundation classes which are attempting to incorporate projects in Illustrator (although I haven&#8217;t been in one that has required it). But a lot of them are using sink-or-swim methods to teach the application that aren&#8217;t working. Are there any plans to ramp up exposure to these art/design tools in the classroom?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Dear Patrice,</p>\n<p>I wish you well with this valuable project.  As you know, it isn&#8217;t easy take time for reflection mid-semester at RISD.  It&#8217;s even less easy to take time to write reflectively: to take time to say something one hasn&#8217;t said before, or to say something one *has* said before but to say it crisply, as a type of action.</p>\n<p>This venue is an unusual one for your purpose, maybe, because two.risd is both public and private&#8212;open to the whole community but not beyond (if a boundary can be drawn around community).  I think two.risd has proved itself as a venue for candid communication though.<br/>\nYour project promises to continue this.</p>\n<p>I came to RISD from the MFA in Creative Program at the University of Mississippi.  From the day of my interview here, when I walked by the looms and studios in College Building, and smelled the paint, I felt I was coming home.  In my twenties, I spent all my time in painters&#8217; studios, galleries, newspaper offices, and the theatre.  These were the spaces in which I learned to write.  My first play was a collaboration with some of the best musicians, designers, and actors in Ireland.  I wrote the play, yes, but the script was one strand&#8212;or loose web&#8212;in an astoundingly luminous and vibrant mix.  </p>\n<p>When I came to America, to enter a graduate program in creative writing and then a Ph.D. in Literary Theory and Cultural Studies, I entered a much more sterile environment.  It was very fertile in terms of having time to think, to write.  But sterile in terms of collaboration with the other arts, audience, and publication.  The discipline of creative writing, in America, is housed in universities, usually in English Departments.  I missed the other arts, but it was necessary for me to come. </p>\n<p>When I came to RISD, I felt I had been restored to a familiar and productive context, a space where the arts&#8211;among which I always include writing, flourished side-by-side.  At that time, the English Department was talking about establishing an MFA Program in Creative Writing so it was even more exciting. </p>\n<p>Seven years later, I am still in love with RISD and still find it an enormously vital space for teaching, thinking, and writing.  As a teacher of writing, my job is certainly made very difficult by the fact that, outside the first year program in the English Department, there is no coordinated structure for writing at RISD.  It&#8217;s very difficult to develop, produce, or build anything.</p>\n<p>In Ireland, at the time I left, there were no undergraduate or graduate programs in writing.  In America, there are programs, but they are nearly always in universities, apart from the other arts.  At RISD, as with some other art and design schools, there is writing but no writing program.  Is it possible to be at home even when you fit awkwardly?  Maybe no-one feels a smooth fit.</p>\n<p>Through my work on the Admissions Committee, I know that many students make difficult choices when they come here.  These may be financial, personal, or&#8212;in many cases&#8212;involve developing one area of practice, i.e., art and design, at the expense of another, e.g., music, Mathematics, languages, athletics, or the sciences.  In their second semester, students are presented with another difficult choice: to declare a major.  By and large it works, and you weigh advantages against disadvantages, as I do, and come up with a good overall package.  For me this includes students of whom I think so highly I can&#8217;t attach adjectives to; colleagues full of ideas, knowledge, and expertise; a creative and intellectual environment exemplified perhaps by the light, thrilling, and vivid Digital+Media symposium on Embodiment and Mobility yesterday, so rich in RISD and Brown thinking and practice (I mean people associated with RISD and Brown, but institutions think: not one voice at a time, Patrice, but somehow when brave voices join together).</p>\n<p>But say if inside Rhode Island School of Design there was another school&#8212;Rhode Island School of Imaginative Conceptualization and Inventive Structures.  Rhode Island School of Dreams.  Rhode Island School of Possible Arts.  Rhode Island School of Living and Thinking.  The genius of reinventing structures is as essential as the genius of art and design.</p>\n<p>My long response may be off-putting for others tempted to participate in your project.  I hope not.  I&#8217;ll close on a more personal note.  I&#8217;m an immigrant in a small college of many cultures:  I feel at home.  I am a female faculty member with children:  I feel alienated.  I live in Mount Pleasant in Providence, three miles but in some ways light years from RISD.  One of the strangest things about RISD, for me, is the absence of children.  I don&#8217;t even know how there can be art without children.  But I suppose that&#8217;s what my life has been about&#8212;and that&#8217;s where RISD is a school.  Finally I&#8217;ll say, even on my despondent days, I still get a huge lift just walking by studios, and smelling paint.\n</p><p/></div>",

Challenging?&#8232;<br/>\nWorking at risd is definitely rewarding, but also challenging. We need left brain people like me at risd to deal with the routine and mundane. When people hear I work at risd, they often say, &#8220;You work at risd. You must be an artist.&#8221; My standard reply to that is, &#8220;No. I work at risd so the artists can be artists. Somebody has to do the paperwork.&#8221; While I say people in roles like mine take care of the routine and mundane, working at risd is never boring. There are so many talented and interesting people that you meet and interact with on a daily basis that each day is different.<br/>\n&#187; Do you have difficulty adjusting to this environment?&#8232;<br/>\nInitially, since I had no academic experience prior to coming to work at risd, I felt like I was learning a foreign language. What were staffing plans and curriculum tables? However, it was interesting and exciting to see how all the pieces of this puzzle called academia fit together.<br/>\n&#187; Is this environment what you expected it to be?&#8232;<br/>\nI can&#8217;t say if it is or isn&#8217;t. I had no idea what to expect. Obviously, it has been fascinating enough to keep me here for 18 years so there has to be something that makes me feel connected in this environment.<br/>\n&#187; Do you feel like your voice is heard within the RISD community?&#8232;<br/>\nYes, I do feel that my voice is heard. Partly, it is heard because I am assertive and make sure that if I have something that I think is important to the community I say it to the people who can do something about it. Partly, it is heard because I am and have been involved in the Staff Council since the early planning stages of creating that group. Partly, it is heard because people know that I am involved in the risd community and want it to be valued and appreciated for the wonderful, unique place it is. Partly, it is heard because people know that I won&#8217;t go away until they answer me.<br/>\n&#187; Do you feel isolated or do you feel &#8220;right at home&#8221;?&#8232;<br/>\nI fell right at home. Sometimes other staff members and I will share comments or stories about the crazy place this can be. Then we agree that that is what keeps us here and that we are just as crazy as the rest of the folks here.<br/>\n&#187; Do you feel like you belong?&#8232;<br/>\nYes. That is one thing that I&#8217;ve always appreciated about risd is that I feel faculty value and appreciate the contribution of staff in the academic environment much more so than folks in a corporate environment value what staff provides to their organization.<br/>\n&#187; Have you met others within the community that share a similar experience?&#8232;<br/>\nAbsolutely. All you have to do is go around and ask staff members how long they&#8217;ve been here. You&#8217;ll find many people with 10, 15, 20, 25 or more years as risd employees. My theory is that risd is a unique environment. When new staff come in, especially in the academic departments, they either enjoy the environment or the place drives them nuts and they are gone in two years.<br/>\n&#187; Or do you think your experience is unique from everyone else?<br/>\nNo, I don&#8217;t think my experience is unique. As I said in the previous paragraph, either you belong here or you don&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t, you should leave.\n</p><p/></div>",

When I walk around campus and connect with students here, I feel a kindred spirit. </p>\n<p>For instance today when I sat in the Watermark Cafe with a freshman, I heard how she felt her 2nd term was much easier than her 1st term. Something to the effect that it was so hard to get through the 1st term, and now that she was acclimated and more skilled that the 2nd term seemed to cruise by for her. She spoke of a kind of sense of &#8220;guilt&#8221; or hesitation to feel happy about the fact that it was easier for her. That it was the difficulty that she missed. The struggle. </p>\n<p>A few minutes later I mentioned this story to our Provost Jessie Shefrin, who simply said, &#8220;All artists yearn for the struggle. The best work comes out of it.&#8221; As someone who has always consciously sought out discomfort in his art or design projects, I felt very home here at RISD. -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Thank you Prof. Byrne, Susan, Ms. DiNapoli, Prof. Bruton, and Pres. Maeda for your comments and responses. </p>\n<p>I would also like to respond to the question: &#8220;Do you feel like you belong?&#8221; However, I would like to rephrase that question and ask: &#8220;What does it mean to belong?&#8221; When you belong you feel comfortable within your environment. Sometimes it is hard to adjust to an environment that you are unfamiliar with, but that does not necessarily mean that you cannot be a part of it &#8211; it just means you have to push yourself to find your own niche or carve out your own space within that environment. It is especially important that within your environment you find a community of people that share similar interests and goals &#8211; they will eventually become your support. When I first arrived to RISD, I was nervous, did not know what to expect, and often feared that maybe I just did not fit in. However, I find that now in my second semester I am starting to connect with more people who not only share my passion for art, but also my interest in community-building, social interaction, and finding a sense of place. I hope that while I am here I can continue making these connections because they are very important to my growth.\n</p><p/></div>",

As fellow artists, however, they also deserve our respect for their copyrights.  So, just as we generally can&#8217;t post someone else&#8217;s painting, photograph, film, elevation, or song without consent, we also generally can&#8217;t post someone else&#8217;s poem without consent.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways we could post/recognize poems in this context (other, broader rules apply in the classroom):</p>\n<p>1.  If they&#8217;re your own poems, and you haven&#8217;t transferred your copyright.  (Mairead, Arnie, and you, too, Marcos:  post away!)</p>\n<p>2.  If they&#8217;re in the public domain.  (Generally speaking, anything published before 1923 is now in the public domain.)</p>\n<p>3.  If you can link to them at a publicly accessible web site, but not copy them here.</p>\n<p>If none of these things is possible, the best thing to do would be to identify and describe them, note where they can be found, and encourage the rest of us to search them out and share in your enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Steve the copyright guy</p>\n<p><em><strong>[note from Liz L.: I will look for URLs for the poems already posted.

The students were mixing a commonly used textile dye, and one of the component agents overheated and emitted fumes.</p>\n<p>In accordance with established RISD protocol, students contacted RISD&#8217;s Departments of Public Safety and Environmental Health + Safety, who responded promptly with the Providence Fire Department and the Department of Environmental Management.  The building was evacuated immediately, and the contained area was cleaned and deemed safe for occupancy.  The two students and a Public Safety officer were taken to Rhode Island Hospital as a precaution, and have since been evaluated and released.</p>\n<p>As always, the safety of our students is our primary concern. Students are trained in the proper use of chemicals and specialized equipment in various art and design disciplines, and are taught the proper procedures for action when an incident occurs.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the quick and professional response from the Providence Fire Department and the DEM, and are grateful that everyone involved is healthy and safe.</p></div>",

Their quick thinking and clear concern for students will always be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Second, the sad truth.  Safety NEEDS to be a primary concern, but I don&#8217;t think we are quite there.  As a fellow Textiles Student, I realize this incident was a result of both an accident, aka a product was left too close to a burner, and a lack of knowledge of spill procedures.  See, we are not taught about the toxicity levels of the chemical we use, nor are we told who to call or what to do if there is a chemical spill.  In this case, one of the students just had the common sense to call public safety after the fumes became overwhelming, but had procedure been taught, maybe part of this could have been avoided.</p>\n<p>I am very paranoid about Safety Procedures, especially since I have Anosmia (aka, I can&#8217;t smell).  I have noticed that there is a lack of enforcement in holding up these procedures and I sure hope that this acts as a wake up call.  It is hard to constantly tell people that they are hurting themselves when the school does not spell out the safety procedures students should be adhering to.  Furthermore, enforcement by fellow students and the department should be in place.</p>\n<p>I am relieved everyone involved is doing fine, and once again, thanks to all who helped out last night/ this morning.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>There are many positive safety and environmental things happening on campus some controlled by the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Department and some by the individual departments.  For example, the HMIS labeling program that is prevalent in Textiles and very well enforced is an EHS program administered and monitored by Textiles.  That&#8217;s how we identified the chemical involved in the incident from the HMIS label.  Likewise the same can be said for the MSDS program - administered and managed by EHS with data gathering from Textiles.  BTW - It was RISD&#8217;s MSDS program that quickly identified the material in the incident as Thiox and produced the MSDS for Public Safety, DEM and Prov. Fire Department.  Prior to that nobody was quite sure what the material was.  See the attached website that highlights most of the EHS programs on campus you will see a spill reporting procedure.  Most if not all departments have this procedure posted in key areas of their departments.  <a href=\"http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/Default.aspx?d=Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety&amp;eid=898&amp;id=1928&amp;hid=892&amp;aid=1290&amp;lid=896&amp;did=890&amp;pid=894\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://intranet.risd.edu/Departments/Default.aspx?d=Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety&amp;eid=898&amp;id=1928&amp;hid=892&amp;aid=1290&amp;lid=896&amp;did=890&amp;pid=894</a><br/>\nI do agree that more can be done relative to safety and the environment, but I think the problem is not the lack of programs but how they are communicated to faculty and students.  Many already contact us, but if anyone in the RISD Community (student, faculty, staff) ever wants to discuss environmental, health or safety or has a question, do not hesitate to stop by or call the EHS Department.  Our phone number is 454-6780 and we are located under the archway in College Building just opposite Textiles.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Good point about the methylene chloride.  This is one of those materials that would make my list of the top five chemicals to do away with on campus.  EHS working with the Metcalf Store have tried to replace this particular solvent at least four or five times, unfortunately it does a great job doing what it does (melting plastics together) other replacement solvents have not worked as well.  BTW - The entire RISD community used 10 gallons of methylene chloride in 2008, a relatively small but still significant amount.  The EHS Department&#8217;s goal is to eliminate exposures using material replacement with less toxic materials, using engineering controls such as good local ventilation and then lastly using personal protective equipment.  Adam, I am glad to see that you have read the MSDS for this material and I suspect that you have also read these for other artistic materials you use, many of our students have not.  I would love to begin a constructive dialog on the steps RISD can take to get MSDS&#8217;s read by faculty, students and staff before they use a material, I don&#8217;t think it is happening enough.  Regarding inhalation hazards from chemicals our goal would be zero exposure, but realistically unless you are working in a bio level 3 lab that probably won&#8217;t always happen.  BTW - The EHS Department at RISD uses OSHA (applies to workforce) regulations as a minimum standard and some of our programs are stricter than OSHA but never less strict.  So anyway if you look at the MSDS it tells you OSHA limits and ACGIH recommended guidelines of exposure.  For example, the STEL (Short term exposure limit) for methylene chloride is 125 ppm.  I can&#8217;t think of any use at RISD that would create 125 ppm exposure short of a relatively large spill.  The other limits are 8 hour averages and I don&#8217;t think anyone at RISD works with methylene chloride for 8 hours per day.  So even though you can smell it while you are working with it and it isn&#8217;t necessarily good for you OSHA says you can be exposed to it without any problems.  Under OSHA the use of respirators are optional unless you exceed a limit and then required &#8211; that is why we use engineering controls to reduce exposures below limits.  Also under OSHA there is a respirator standard that is quite rigorous and although again it is enforceable by OSHA via the employer- employee relationship it is not OSHA enforceable to students, but we would still look to that program for guidance.  If you read through the standard you will see that there is medical surveillance, training, testing and recordkeeping requirements.  Using Industrial Hygiene testing in many areas on campus  I have not found one exposure above an OSHA limit that would require the use of a respirator.  As you can see, this discussion goes way beyond a blog discussion and into many nuances of OSHA, best practices, practical application and implementation.  Adam you also mentioned gloves.  The purple nitrile gloves used almost over the entire campus are great for many things but again if you read the MSDS not so for methylene chloride.  To your point, the EHS Department working with the store can begin to spec out the right gloves and provide them to the students when they purchase methylene chloride.  Thanks for bringing up chronic versus acute exposures to chemicals.  This is a great context in which to discuss exposures.  Artists really need to think about how to use materials both at RISD and in their professional careers to make sure they minimize exposures.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>My Name is Peter Paniccia and I run the Supply store. First let me say thank you to Adam and Alan for this discussion. As Alan mentioned methylene chloride can be a dangerous chemical in some circumstances. We have and continue to look for replacement. We do offer alternatives but unfortunately none work as well as methylene chloride to bond plexi-glas or other plastics. A quick history on how we have sold this product. When I started at the store 10 years ago (time flies when your having fun) we would buy it in a wide mouth gallon container and dispense it in the store (with out a hood) into needle topped bottles. The plastic bottle was expensive because of what they were made of and the methylene chloride would evaporate. The needle top bottle was dangerous on shop tables because of risk of accidental injection. I found the same product packaged in small metal containers under the name Weld on 3. The new container was labeled properly, could be stored and the chemical would not evaporate from them. We also began offering syringes for application because they only hold what is needed for each application and make it easier to control the application (less chance of spillage). I continue to look for another product that works as well but have yet to find one. The bottles are clearly labeled and MSDS are available upon request. There is no substitute for safety and taking precautions with any chemicals. The user should always know what they are using and how to protect them selves. Personally and as the manager of the store I would like nothing better than to be able to say here is a safer product that works just as well. Until that day I do not see a choice but to offer it as an option considering it is what would be used in industry after leaving RISD. I am open to keeping this discussion going and would welcome ideas on the mater. Many of the changes and products in our store come about from others suggestions so please share your ideas because it helps everyone. I can be contacted directly at <a href=\"mailto:ppanicci@risd.edu\">ppanicci@risd.edu</a>\n</p><p/></div>",

Jewelry is the only major I know of with a dedicated fume hood for such products. My department has a policy of not allowing any processes other than spraypainting in our booth, which is where we would typically use the more icky things (smoothcast 300, expansion foam), before the reorganization of the booth. This is understandable because these are messy materials, but it is unreasonable to confine these materials to the outdoors because they are all temperature-sensitive.<br/>\nMany of these products are considered acceptable for use with ventilation and it is fortunate that our studio has two very large window fans which provide a strong draft, but there are many rooms which do not have the same amenities where moldmaking and casting nonetheless takes place.</p>\n<p>Also, Clear Cast resin (the blue tins) at the Metcalf store is a polyester resin.

We can only go <i>higher</i> by all working together. I&#8217;m reminded of my favorite phrase in Japanese <img src=\"http://our.risd.edu/wp-content/uploads/ue.gif\"/> which translates simply to <i>&#8220;Above up, there is up.&#8221;</i></p></div>",

I am a regular Student Alliance attendee and I feel like I am not being heard or represented.</p>\n<p>I hate to pick on What We Do, but I never agreed to the ways in which it was going to be organzied, I never got a vote. Our department representatives in Student Alliance never came to us and told us what was going on and asked us what our stance was on any of the many topics going on in Student Alliance.</p>\n<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that the way it works is that the agenda was to be sent out before the meetings so that the Reps could bring it to their departments. The rep then could go back to the meeting and vote the way their department agreed on. My reps aren&#8217;t representing my opinion, just their own. And I have been to many more meetings than many of my department reps have. Perhaps there should be only so many times you can miss before you are replaced?</p>\n<p>I feel like my Reps doesn&#8217;t represent me. They don&#8217;t tell me what is going on or ask my opinion. And I am not a Rep so I cannot be there for the vote. I don&#8217;t get to vote. This is why I think that all votes should be put out directly to the student body. We do have email, we do have forums. Perhaps issues to be voted on could be sent out by email. Or the way in which the SA president is voted on, on the internet.</p>\n<p>I really feel like Student Alliance is a free for all, and that it is operating as a platform for those in power to get what they want.</p></div>",

It&#8217;s just a matter of how long of a time you might have available to start towards an understanding. </p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t here during the age of the student space discussions, and I have heard various recounts of what had occurred. From time to time I sit in the student space in the Store area and read my messages or try and catch a student. Like most spaces of gathering for a community that is ultra-busy, it is often underutilized. But that&#8217;s okay. Sometimes it does work. It&#8217;s the times when it does that makes the efforts of the many that were involved in the past, matter in the present.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not 100% certain on this, but What We Do wasn&#8217;t an SA event, but instead a renegade event by a few students with some of them incidentally SA folks and some not. What is a truly proud thing is that it was all *students* &#8212; with the support of folks from Dr. Barbara Fienman&#8217;s office and other offices. In that sense, it is a good sign that bureaucracy is being lessened at RISD. Getting things done matters to me, and having them done by the people that want to do them is meaningful energy that should be expended. Such is what we learn from the ethos of art and design. </p>\n<p>We are living in an age where the question of what &#8220;leadership&#8221; is has begun to ring in new ways. Anonymous9:09AM&#8217;s point on the question of &#8220;representation&#8221; lives at the heart of the debate. I <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/09/30/we-together-are-the-indomitable-strength/\" rel=\"nofollow\">related</a> the story once of how a fellow on YouTube was urging people under 18 to get involved with the election last year &#8212; because even though they couldn&#8217;t vote, they now had a voice due to the Internet. Representation is possible in many ways now. At RISD, the fact that Anonymous9:09AM spoke up and his/her concerns are heard by the president only minutes later is something rather radical.</p>\n<p>On the question of &#8220;power&#8221; &#8212; this is something that I know in the many courses taught here at RISD comes in many ways. The power of expression (the studio experience or via a writing experience). The power of corruption (history tells most of the story or via a light dose of artistic forgery). As for power here at RISD writ in general terms, I believe the only power that truly matters here is the <i>power to learn.</i> So in that sense there is great power in this two.risd.edu entity as we are all learning together about what works, what doesn&#8217;t, what we do, and what we can&#8217;t do. </p>\n<p>Lastly regarding the SA, it&#8217;s important that you say how you feel to them. And to me too. So thanks for communicating. <i>Communi</i>cation is the big step towards a stronger <i>communi</i>ty. Thanks again, -JM\n</p><p/></div>",

Their grades in the class could depend on reviews by their peers at the mid-term and end of the semester they serve.  If the students did not feel well represented, it would affect the grade of their representatives.  It would be a have to be a large class, maybe 100 seats or more?  But I think it may still be one of the ones that would fill up fast, and have a long waiting list.

        "content": "<div><p>Mandatory volunteering? Oxymoron aside, I think the concept is well-intentioned but out of place. My response to a school requiring community service is parallel with wondering why schools have required yearly dental screenings. Isn&#8217;t it the parents&#8217; responsibility to get their child to a dentist? Why does the school need to drag in a dentist to look at every child? When I was growing up we had yearly checks for scoliosis in the school too. Perhaps my regular doctor couldn&#8217;t be trusted? When I went to school we ate breakfast at home. We&#8217;re so worried about kids not being fed well these days that we provide breakfast options in addition to lunch. Somehow the school transformed from educator to surrogate parent.</p>\n<p>Regarding community service, my guess is that educators and/or administrators noticed parents were either &#8216;failing&#8217; to instill in their own children a healthy dose of civic duty, or simply weren&#8217;t doing enough, and decided it was the charge of the public institution to do it for them. But they couldn&#8217;t simply use the proverbial stick to get kids to go along with their new plan for community service so they tie the proverbial carrot to said stick and hold graduation hostage. You&#8217;re going to be civic minded, or at least pretend to for 20 hours, or it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have a 4.0 GPA, you&#8217;re not going to graduate. </p>\n<p>When I was growing up my parents ensured my brother and I spent countless hours volunteering for everything from food drives and library book sales to clearing brush at the Potter League animal shelter. They involved us in other activities (I was an Eagle Scout) that also reinforced the values of duty and service. The difference between a program like Scouting and public school is the &#8216;mandatory&#8217; nature. Scouting was a choice. School is a requirement. (I could digress here about my disgust over BSA&#8217;s anti-gay policy here and how it made me feel like a hypocrite but I won&#8217;t.) When you&#8217;re doing something because you CHOOSE to do it, you will always take away more from the experience. That lasting connection is what will bring you back to do more, isn&#8217;t it? If parents/guardians are doing their job, the family&#8217;s civic values will be transferred to the next generation. In that process, perhaps the bond between family members is also strengthened. When the school steps in and does it, the values are generic and lack a family orientation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, looking at the most recent NECAP data, the schools should focus on improving the results of their core objectives before taking another bite of the responsibility apple. All that said, some parents do fail horribly and for that reason alone I can understand why a public school steps in and feeds the breakfast, checks the teeth and makes them good members of the community.</p>\n<p>A final note on incentivizing: To speak more directly to the quality of an elected representative when the position happens to come with some nice perks I need look no further than the RI Congress. A part-time job that pays $12K/yr and comes with full health benefits for you and your family. Who wouldn&#8217;t fight to keep a position like that! I say strip out the perks and we&#8217;ll be one step closer to leaders who do so, hopefully, for more noble purposes.\n</p><p/></div>",

Kennedy.</p>\n<p>From the producing team, that won an Academy Award for Born Into Brothels, comes WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?, a film that examines some of the most pressing issues of our time: parenting and work, partnering and independence, economics and art. The film follows five women artists as they navigate the economic, psychological, and spiritual challenges of making work outside the elite art world. From Hawaii&#8217;s Big Island to the suburbs of Ohio, from New York City to the deserts of New Mexico, we watch as these women&#8212;ranging in age from 27 to 65&#8212;fight to honor their vision and their families every day.</p>\n<p>Interviews with experts like Riane Eisler (The Chalice and the Blade), Maura Reilly (Sackler Center for Feminist Art-Brooklyn Museum) and the Guerrilla Girls add a cultural context for these women&#8217;s uplifting journeys. It is not accolades they seek; it&#8217;s simply the radical opportunity to live whole.</p>\n<p>Pamela Tanner Boll co-executive produced the Academy award-winning film, &#8220;Born into Brothels: The Kids of Calcutta&#8217;s Red Light District. She is currently producing the film projects: Global Moms; Life on the Edge: True Stories of Doctors Without Borders; 9/12: From Chaos to Community; Kashmir; and In a Dream.</p>\n<p>Nancy C. Kennedy edited the Sundance Grand Jury winner Why We Fight (2005) and Sundance winners Thank You and Goodnight and Riding the Rails. She also co-directed and edited Bluegrass Journey and Who&#8217;s On First.</p></div>",

As a part of this charge, we want to collect information from RISD faculty and staff about childcare issues as well as interest in various possible solutions in order for us to better serve the needs of the community.  The Childcare Taskforce is committed to exploring and recommending practical solutions that meet the needs of the community while being sensitive to the current economic climate.  We would appreciate you taking the time to complete this short online survey (even if you do not have children), as we would like input from all members of the RISD community.

On Friday we had our annual scholarship luncheon to bring together donors with their scholarship recipients, and at that event we had the chance to honor the surviving family of the late Professor Prip. For the event I had asked the Prip family if they could bring some of the articles made by Prof. Prip, and the above photos are the ones I examined so as to get a better understanding of his handiwork first hand. </p>\n<p>The first item is a jewelry box. One of the J&amp;M students described it as unique for the way the matte surface was well-shadowed and had strong formal characteristics. The other item is a brooch. A comment from another J&amp;M student was her appreciation for its sense of whimsy and portraiture. It struck me that others might want to add a word about Prof Prip as a person and about his work so I open this strand as such. A memorial service will be held at 2pm on Saturday, June 6, in RISD&#8217;s Woods-Gerry Gallery. -JM</p></div>",

If everyone contributes in some way to make this event happen, instead of merely showing up to an event someone else planned, it will truly bring the faculty and staff together and will allow for a deeper appreciation and connection to the other members of the community.

I&#8217;ve worked at the Nature Lab for two and a half years, and in that time I&#8217;ve seen some of these animals (particularly fish) dumped at the Nature Lab after the students are &#8220;done&#8221; with them. We then have the task of trying to care for these unexpected (and stressed) animals, which we may or may not have room for, when in my opinion they really ought to have been bought by people who would actually care for them and keep them instead of being somebody&#8217;s disposable &#8220;art.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d actually like to see a RISD policy dictating a code of ethics for using animals in work. I know nobody wants policies telling them what they can and can&#8217;t do with their art&#8212;I&#8217;m against censorship too&#8212;but to me this is a little bit different. Now, I&#8217;m not seeing anyone torturing or starving dogs here at RISD (look up the story on Costa Rican artist Guillermo Vargas), but in my opinion, buying an animal, subjecting it to a stressful environment, and then abandoning it is still cruel and unnecessary, even if it&#8217;s a goldfish.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m okay with people taking photos of wild animals or pets as long as the animal isn&#8217;t being hurt or stressed (which CAN cause physical damage). I&#8217;m okay with using animal remains in artwork (I often use salvaged animal parts in my work, the operative word being salvaged). I&#8217;m not okay with somebody treating an animal like a prop, and I&#8217;m definitely not okay with that animal then being abandoned.</p>\n<p>The question is, if we did create a policy regarding the ethical treatment of animals in art pieces, how would we enforce it, and how could we write it carefully so as to permit people to still take photos of animals or possibly even use animals in performance pieces, as long as they are treated with respect and cared for, while cracking down on real animal abuse and neglect?</p></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I support your comments wholeheartedly, but would take it one step further. I would suggest, rather than having a code of ethics, we teach ethics. Animals are not artist medium. They are not spectacle. What is important is that teachers monitor what students do, and if a student plans to use, or does use, an animal in his or her project, teaching the reasons not to do this should be the next part of the learning process. Feeling the equal value of all life, and exercising empathy, is worthy of instruction, and one that can be taught in the context of an art education.</p>\n<p>This brings me to a related point. There are a number of trees on campus that are bound by rope or string in what appears to be some kind of art project or statement. Trees feed right underneath their bark. Sugars and other materials move downward in the outermost layer of cells in the outmost ring. If you bruise this layer, the living cells beneath the bark are killed. They don&#8217;t regenrate like human skin &#8212; they seal off.  Binding will grow into the bark. As the tree grows, it will try to compensate for the binding by growing around it, incorporating the rope into it&#8217;s skin, so to speak. If it&#8217;s means of receiving nutrients is compromised enough, it will die.<br/>\nI think it is vitally important for students to understand that everything is not a canvas. Everything non-human is not a framework for human dalliance. It has to do with respect. As an educational institution, this can be taught.\n</p><p/></div>",

That is fantastic! I can&#8217;t tell you how excited I was when I heard the news! Now I am genuinely interested in gaining further insight into how the library hours come to be at RISD.</p>\n<p>I remember when I was an undergraduate computer science student, the library and the computer clusters were the two main places of focus when it came to engaging in academic work. The computer clusters, which I now realize were akin to studio spaces, were open 24 hours, and the library was open until 3am. When it came close to finals, the library was open 24 hours. This was fantastic!</p>\n<p>To me, the library was not only a place where you could go find books or find a desk to read at. It was a place where you can discover ideas you&#8217;d never thought of, get inspired by them in ways that you never thought possible, and make relationships among them that you didn&#8217;t know existed. It was a place where you could think in ways that were somehow __different__ from the ways you would think in your room or in a computer cluster. You could watch other people read, and you may find yourself wondering what they are reading. Maybe you&#8217;ll even ask them about it. At a library you can not only read and think, but write. You may find it to be more fluid than if you were in a different location. All the while you never feel the time pass by because you become completely immersed in your search. For some odd reason this was __the__ space that allowed me to do all these things effectively. It is only after I learned about the idea of &#8220;design&#8221; that it became clear to me. This space was __designed__ this way.</p>\n<p>Yes, it may perhaps have promoted the culture of students working overly long hours in these two locations. Yes, this was probably unhealthy for the students. Yes, these students may have been inefficient. Yes, these students may have not only been working but chatting with their peers. But none of these can denounce the fantasticness, if that is a word, of this purposefully designed space known as the &#8220;library&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I wonder what kind of effect RISD can have on students by simply changing the library&#8217;s hours of operation? What if it were open until later? I&#8217;m most certain this is a subject of tremendous interest to the entire RISD community.</p>\n<p>slim<br/>\n&#8212;&#8212;<br/>\nSeung Chan is my full first name, and yes it has a space in it.</p></div>",

I am appreciative that the few staff we have in the evening are able to stretch the hours to midnight for these weeks before the end of the semester. Already this library has the longest hours of any of the independent art &amp; design schools; the hours you quoted were no doubt for a much larger university library. While we appreciate that the space of the library is important, we do hope that by providing all hours access to the content in the databases we provide does help somewhat. </p>\n<p>Carol Terry<br/>\nDirector of Library Services\n</p><p/></div>",

I I have just started as a new student in the graduate program this past semester, and I&#8217;m learning more and more about the challenges faced by an independent art &amp; design school vs a university. The more I learn, the more I feel like a spoiled brat. At the same time it is always fascinating when someone figures out an extremely creative solution that balances all the constraints in just the right way. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very curious. What is our biggest difficulty in staffing as it relates to library hours? Is it that our students do not wish to work passed midnight? Is it that we would rather not have our students work passed midnight so that they can get their well-deserved sleep? Is it that we don&#8217;t have the budget to pay for our students to work those extra hours? Is it that we need more than just student staff to keep the library open? Are there additional policies involved? How does the larger universities do it? Sorry to be shooting off so many questions, but I&#8217;m genuinely curious, and would love to learn a thing or two from you so I can first and foremost empathize with the situation.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the access to the content in the database is wonderful. As a matter of fact, when I learned of AP images, and ARTStor access, I almost flipped. That&#8217;s really wonderful that we have access to those valuable information. At the same time, I think the designed space plays a rather big role in making a library what it is. And this is coming from a Computer Scientist who didn&#8217;t think very much of the physical world until recently. <img src=\"http://two.risd.edu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"/></p>\n<p>I really appreciate your insight Carol,</p>\n<p>thanks again!</p>\n<p>slim\n</p><p/></div>",

A number of events coincided to prompt this project, including inspiration provided by RISD President John Maeda, who consistently encouraged RISD students to charge of their school and shape their community.</p>\n<p>A handful of seniors came together to brainstorm ways to give back to RISD, from which a &#8220;green idea&#8221; began to emerge.  The Class of 2009 would reduce RISD&#8217;s waste removal costs by expanding the scope of its new 2nd Life program, a student-run recycling program that reuses and repurposes art materials before they head off to an industrial recycling center.</p>\n<p>2nd Life is a growing resource for RISD students, made possible by the continuous support of the Office of Student Life. Currently, students bring their left over materials to the 2nd Life trailer located along the riverfront. But for many students this has been a difficult process due to the quantity or size of the materials, or the distance they must be carried.  Enter the Class of 2009 Senior Gift.</p>\n<p>Seniors struck upon the idea of a system of bins, one for each studio building, that would make repurposing materials easier, thereby expanding 2nd Life&#8217;s reach significantly. The bins would allow students to collected materials &#8220;locally,&#8221; then put them into the larger system of 2nd Life through these bins.</p>\n<p>RISD President, John Maeda, so liked the idea that he challenged the senior class:  raise enough money for five bins in three weeks and he&#8217;ll buy the sixth bin out of his own money. Tomorrow senior leaders have invited President Maeda to the Student Alliance meeting to reveal where they are in the challenge. (Hint: They told him to bring his check book.)</p>\n<p>To learn more about Senior Gift and 2nd Life, or to watch John Maeda write a check for the Senior Class Gift, be at the Carr Haus Tap Room tomorrow (May 6th) at 6 pm.</p>\n<p>For more information on The Senior Class Gift, email <a href=\"mailto:risdseniorgift@gmail.com\">risdseniorgift@gmail.com</a>.</p></div>",

And I&#8217;m aware in the Met of the fitness center. Brown&#8217;s facilities are available as well I understand. I reflected on the fact however that <i>fun</i> is an elusive concept for creatively intense people. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve asked a few Faculty, Students, and Staff about what their definition of &#8220;fun&#8221; at RISD is. The common response is that there is very little time for fun &#8230; or that &#8220;fun&#8221; is working in studio an extra 3 or 5 or 20 hours. This masochistic view of the world is something I&#8217;m used to at MIT. And yet I&#8217;ve led many efforts in quality of life at MIT (for Faculty, Students, and Staff) to suggest that it&#8217;s always possible to <i>Burn Hard </i>&#8230; but that usually leads to <i>Burn Out.</i> Thus the goal in life, if we&#8217;re talking about true sustainability here, might be instead to just <i>Burn Well.</i></p>\n<p>Fun of course doesn&#8217;t have to be evidenced as perspiration after a game of softball. Fun can be an exciting discussion about a topic that has nothing to do with fine arts or design or the liberal arts. It can be just about &#8230; having <i>fun.</i> What is fun to you?</p></div>",

I have absolutely no interest in making new fancy buildings &#8212; I *do* have an interest in figuring out how to fix the existing buildings. I visited the ISB, FD, FAV buildings and am aware of a sliver of some of the deferred maintenance challenges faced; as well as have been aware of the complex teaching spaces lived by the Liberal Arts faculty as well. As someone who espouses simplicity &#8212; it is my goal to bring the philosophy to RISD.</li>\n<li>As President of RISD per the official By-Laws I have six official &#8220;executive powers&#8221; as President (where one of them is that I can be fired by the Board as you can note &#8230; <smile>). The By-Laws are the official Constitution and I can tell that they&#8217;ve evolved since 1877 in a variety of ways where I&#8217;m certain that a focus on academics can be reignited if we all work together as a team. The slide I showed at the faculty meeting is <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/executive-powers/\">attached</a> and gives us all a general idea of how this President job works at the legal level. I understand it will be a work in continual progress. </smile></li>\n<li>As President I have no real &#8220;powers&#8221; besides the ability to have the opportunity to start to create a sense of community and excitement for the goodness and betterment of RISD together with the Faculty, Students, and Staff. Life is too short to not attempt to do the right things. </li>\n<li>I believe in open and transparent communication. If you visit the internally facing site <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu\">http://two.risd.edu</a> I post mostly *everything* I&#8217;m doing or thinking about where anyone can openly comment; on the externally facing site <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu\">http://our.risd.edu</a> there&#8217;s more information on things happening at RISD. </li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p>All in all my belief is that being President of RISD will be like an open studio course. I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s something to be pigeonholed as &#8220;academics&#8221; or &#8220;administration.&#8221; Every single living person at RISD is here to support the academic mission. And we&#8217;re all working together to create RISD as the &#8220;final project.&#8221; Crit sessions will be the ongoing process of understanding of how to figure out where RISD can go. We have the opportunity to define a &#8220;pedagogical approach&#8221; to college administration at RISD &#8212; it&#8217;s where I think we can go as a community.</p></div>",

We&#8217;ve been experimenting in my department [FAV] with a number of remote collaborations including a web-based call and response video exchange project with students, in Cameroon, France and Korea, all working together on a common, ongoing project.

At a seminar run by the president of Stanford on the role of technology in the classroom, I found myself in a heated debate. I argued that instructional technology does not realize the important aspect of &#8220;role modeling&#8221; as found in a great educational institution. A role model of course can be found among students in a cherished faculty person, a dedicated staff person, an alum that has achieved career (or personal) ideals, a visitor to campus, or more oftenly in a fellow student that has chosen to be a leader among his/her peers. </p>\n<p>For me my greatest role models were those who were incredible practitioners and at the same time extremely generous to those around him/herself. They would not ask, &#8220;What have you done for me lately?&#8221; and instead ask, &#8220;What have you done for <i>others</i> lately?&#8221; Thanks to a role model&#8217;s leadership by example, the world gradually becomes a better place.

It is useful to study what happened with Steve Jobs when he was younger, versus when he came back as the older Steve Jobs. As a youth he was the complete iconoclast (&#8221;F-you&#8221;) genius who was inevitably ousted by his own company; as an older person he came back with a different set of human skills (including is F-you virtuosity) that led him to greater heights. I invite you to look at the subtle distinction.</p>\n<p>What Tino points out is important &#8212; that in the absence of sewing seeds in a field that has gone barren, nature will do its own thing and blossoms still bloom.

For instance, <i>&#8220;Trusteeship Magazine&#8221;</i> &#8212; it reads like a <i>Fortune</i> magazine for academic administrators. I&#8217;m not unaccustomed to such kinds of societal subgroupings and the associate groupthink that occurs, and have resisted the temptation to become categorized. The article points out that the US is behind, and that other countries are ahead in a competitive approach to engaging international audiences &#8212; something that if you just speak to RISD <a href=\"&lt;a href=\" http:=\"\">international students</a> there are viewpoints to be as yet represented. </p>\n<p>On a meta-level, all too often I have seen the power of someone that might self-describe themselves as &#8220;an artist&#8221; or &#8220;a scientist&#8221; or &#8220;an accountant&#8221; or &#8220;a philosopher.&#8221; Happiness awaits for those that feel <i>the fit.</i> There is incredible comfort in the feeling of <i>clicking</i> into the expectations of a category of society, and to also reach for the highest level within that category. </p>\n<p>The popular film, <i>The Matrix,</i> by the Wachowski brothers can seem absurd to many. For me my favorite scene was when the main protagonist unplugs himself from &#8220;the matrix&#8221; and is suddenly <i>freed</i> from its comfort. Freedom of course means to be vulnerable in one sense (body) and invulnerable in another (mind). </p>\n<p><i>Trusteeship</i> espouses the importance of considering the ongoing globalization of higher education. I met the President of VCU at the below-mentioned State Dept meeting who spoke all about the advancement of <a href=\"http://blog.vcu.edu/abroad/\">their programs.</a> As a skeptic of following the beaten path, I must express my joy in <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/04/30/ehpahp/#comment-155\">the post</a> by Prof Peltz about an NCHP &#8212; &#8220;No Country Honor&#8217;s Program&#8221; where international interventions are a combination of local and virtual support. With a reduced carbon footprint and an opportunity to make massive change more probable it seems like a unique direction. Note I&#8217;m just thinking aloud here, and look to listen to other thinkers at RISD &#8212; both loudly and softly voiced. </p>\n<p>At the close of the week at MIT I met with the founder of Kayak.com (a popular Internet travel site) who explained how Ubuntu &#8212; one of the most popular distribution flavors of the Linux operating system &#8212; and the company&#8217;s approach of openness is to him also a way of life. Ubuntu coming from the Burundi words for <i>&#8220;humanity to others.&#8221;</i> It would seem in this century and centuries beyond, our means of delivering <i>ubuntu</i> will involve new practices that are as yet uninvented. RISD may have the tools to get our world there.</p></div>",

It is translated there to mean &#8220;you are a person because of other people&#8221; and to encompass interrelatedness, compassion, sacrifice and face-to-face interaction.  I am intrigued that Linux uses the term.  Rather than coming up with &#8220;new practices&#8221; perhaps we are looking at the modernization of &#8220;old practices&#8221; ie., is there anything really &#8216;new&#8217; about the basics of human interactions, compassion, and aesthetic capacities?  I really wonder if the high tech hype is not just new packaging and new vehicles to deliver core skills around how we deal with each other.  If that is the case, and my life and global experience suggest it is, then to make the technologies work for us we have to still strive to master the basics.  To relate this to the discussion on where and how we program internationally, especially beyond the usual suspects in our European partnerships - the new technologies can certainly help us reduce our jetsetting around, and Prof Peltz has a great model.  We need to make sure they simultaneously assist us with learning how to relate to difference and diversity.  Add, to complicate this mix, that the cultures of Asia, Africa and Latin America that we would like to partner with value face-to-face contact highly, and in ways that are yet unfamiliar to most Westerners.  Sorry for the rambling post, but I wanted to respond to a number of issues raised and I am not an experienced blogger.  Even I can learn new ways to interact!\n</p><p/></div>",

We have seen how much a creative, sometimes wild, idea can provoke change. In Providence, the RISD design communities have played key roles in creating the vibrant renaissance we see today. We need to keep looking out past the horizon and bringing the creative explorations of the studio into public policy discussions for how the city and the region should grow, what it means to be a sustainable city of the future, how we can become a healthier, more prosperous and more beautiful place. This is what City-State, the Urban Design Lab at RISD has been doing for several years. The Lab has also been a vehicle for effective collaborations with Brown and across RISD departments. I think this kind of investigation, rooted in real and significant opportunities and crossing disciplinary boundaries offers a fantastic opportunity for students to learn to imagine and to make change in the world.\n</p><p/></div>",

Training too much for &#8220;the trade&#8221; is good in the short term but bad for the long term because your skills quickly become outdated.

    "content": "<div><p>I have been blogging for almost 4 years <a href=\"http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000042.html\">now</a> as a kind of ongoing self-analysis that I have learned has served utility to hundreds of thousands of visitors who are curious about life. It said that &#8220;it is lonely at the top.&#8221; I can say with 100% confidence that the same can be said anywhere you might be in a hierarchy. It can be lonely in the middle. It can be lonely in the very bottom. It is easy to be lonely anywhere you go &#8212; even when you are surrounded by many people around you. Thus a blog is a simple way to at least attempt to reduce loneliness &#8212; it is the quickest path to engaging as many minds as possible with the hopes of turning what is positive into something even more positive, and also the opportunity to change what is negative into something positive as well.</p>\n<p>In Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s brilliant book entitled <i>The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom</i> he raises on page 29:<br/></p><blockquote>[there is the common design principle in life that] <i>bad is stronger than good.</i> Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures. This principle, called &#8220;negativity bias,&#8221; shows up all over psychology. In marital interactions, it takes at least five good or constructive actions to make up the for the damage done by one critical or destructive act. In financial transactions and gambles, the pleasure of gaining a certain amount of money is smaller than the pain of losing the same amount.</blockquote>\n<p>Haidt says what we all know from our own experience &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to <i>hurt</i> than it is to be <i>happy</i>. </p>\n<p>Life can hurt. And when you&#8217;re lonely at the top, bottom, middle, or really anywhere in life it&#8217;s impossible to not want to face and own your own fall &#8230; yet at the same time look for a constructive solution to get yourself out of the hurt. For instance on one dark day at MIT I had a bad <a href=\"http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000465.html\">moment</a> that reminded me of a similar occasion from ten or so years prior. Moving forward in life seems to be what we are programmed to do by the laws of biological evolution. It&#8217;s certainly a wondrous thing we all live together as <i>life</i>.</p>\n<p>Life can be happy. I saw a lecture by a RISD alum <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/05/10/the-tuxedo-travels/\">Doug Campbell</a> that made me especially proud as I myself enter my new life as a RISDoid. Creativity makes oneself happy, and it often makes everyone around the nexus of creativity enter a state of enchantment and wonder. Doug&#8217;s tale of traveling across Asia with a friend wearing nothing but a tuxedo struck me as not just a way of life, but a <i>new</i> way of life. He inspired me to think about what might be the equivalent of the entirety of RISD to wear a tuxedo and engage in a wanderlust-driven trek around the entire globe (and universe). </p>\n<p>This week has been a long and challenging one for me and others close to me as we begin the countdown to my official arrival in June and as I begin to work with all of you to lay a path towards the future of our RISD. This blog is available to the community to intimately share with you the good news, any news, the unfortunate news, and most importantly the hopes that I share with you for the RISD that comes after President Mandle steps down after commencement. It is open for you to engage in conversations and questions that follow basic <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/anonymous-posting-guidelines/\">guidelines</a> of online civility, and is something that I had always wished I had available to me as a faculty person at MIT and even as a student as well. </p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting and wondering together how we might think about the RISD that the world will newly know us as after my official arrival in now twenty-ish days. I am working to ensure that the transition from Mandle to Maeda is something that reduces any natural feelings of uncertainty out there and that the fall term starts as normal without hesitation. <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/maedas-three-resolutions/\">Rules #1-#4</a> are things I will hold strongly to as my spiritual compass for piloting RISD forward as we tiptoe into this new century.</p></div>",

I want to let all of you know, as of June 30, 2008, I will be stepping down as Provost.</p>\n<p>RISD is a creative haven. For me RISD is made even richer by the extraordinary community of colleagues and genuine friends I work with, including students, faculty, deans, staff and RISD trustees. In particular, the opportunity to work throughout these years with President Roger Mandle has been a privilege.</p>\n<p>I have approached everything I have done at RISD with the same creative excitement that drew me to the arts in the first place. I have immensely enjoyed my work as the lead institutional advocate for the academic programs and faculty at RISD. I have also found tremendous rewards in working one-on-one with students in my studio classes.  I am very proud of what we have achieved together, though it has definitely been a busy time with little opportunity for artistic renewal.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been at RISD for 26 years, starting in 1982 as a professor in the Sculpture Department, serving next as Head of Sculpture, in Rome as Chief Critic of the European Honors Program, and, for the past 14 years, serving in a series of leadership positions- as Dean of Fine Arts (1994-2002), Associate Provost for Academic Affairs (2002-05), Interim Provost (2005-06) and, most recently, as your Provost.</p>\n<p>I will be taking some sabbatical time during which I will explore how to make my next contribution whether as artist, educator, or institutional leader. I have deferred many creative projects, from studio work, to writing about art and design education in collaboration with Australian professor, Brad Buckley (RISD &#8216;82), to a film project based on the work of my great-grandfather Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of National History and noted for describing and naming the Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor. Inspired by my recent visits with leaders of art academies across China, I look forward to expanding international relationships and dialogues. I will continue to work with the Providence-Rhode Island Knowledge Economy Initiative, serve as a director on the Board of the College Art Association, and chair the Advisory Board of Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art.</p>\n<p>I will be working closely with John Maeda to plan for a smooth continuation of all Academic Affairs operations. It is understandable that there will be concern for what comes next, and John and I are committed to openly and expeditiously sharing information regarding these plans.</p>\n<p>I look forward to continuing to be a member of the RISD community. I have great hope for our future. I know we will all be invaluable contributors to the success of John&#8217;s presidency as he forms his team to take RISD into the future.</p>\n<p>With warmest regards,<br/>\nJay</p></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>To the RISD community,</p>\n<p>As I move closer toward to my &#8220;graduation&#8221; from RISD on May 31, I am ever mindful of the transition ripples that will take place as John Maeda assumes his position as RISD&#8217;s 16th President on June 1. Jay Coogan&#8217;s decision to step down from his position as RISD Provost is among the most significant of these, and it is with mixed emotion that I must honor Jay&#8217;s request for a long-overdue sabbatical starting on July 1.</p>\n<p>Jay has been a devoted RISD colleague for 26 years, since he began in 1982 as a professor in the Sculpture Department and then served in many positions of increasing responsibility: as Head of the Department of Sculpture and Chief Critic of the European Honors Program, as Dean of Fine Arts, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, Interim Provost, and now as Provost. In that capacity Jay has overseen all graduate and undergraduate academic and student programs, the Career Services Office, the Center for Design and Business, Continuing Education, the Library, and the Office of Information Technology. His accomplishments are many, and I am exceedingly grateful to Jay for his loyal partnership in all that we have worked together to achieve with you.</p>\n<p>Most recently, in 2008, Jay has worked to develop an Academic Plan for RISD; supported the evolution of diversity at RISD with particular work with the Office of Multicultural and International Affairs leading to the recent award of RISD&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_diversity.htm\">Diversity Awards</a>; spearheaded the development and fruition of the <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/email/brownrisd/index.html\">Brown/RISD Dual Degree</a> program; and nurtured the Office of Public Engagement to support the work of students, faculty and staff to engage in local, national and international public outreach projects. Jay oversaw the development of RISD&#8217;s Self-Study for successful reaccreditation in 2006; championed development of the Fletcher and Mason buildings to provide a new graduate facility in downtown Providence and establish greater identity for the graduate programs at RISD; established the Green Initiatives Group to foster discussion and implementation of green initiatives at RISD; developed the Collaborative Study Option, the recently expanded Internship Program and revisions to Wintersession in collaboration with the Instruction and Wintersession Committees; developed <em>Pixilerations,</em> a digital installation, video and performing arts collaborative program between RISD, Brown and FirstWorks that is now in its 5th year; and established the collaborative program between RISD, Bradley Hospital and Brown in Arts and Healing.</p>\n<p>If anyone has earned a sabbatical (and our profound thanks) for his own creative renewal, it is Jay Coogan. The job of Provost is among the most challenging at any academic institution; Jay has been a wonderful leader at an important time in RISD&#8217;s history.  My deepest thanks to Jay for his rich contributions to improve the fabric of academic and student life at RISD, and his steadfast commitment to the qualities and ethos of the college. Please join me in expressing gratitude to Jay and in wishing him well.</p>\n<p>Roger Mandle<br/>\nPresident<br/>\n________________</p>\n<p>While it is difficult to include in the body of a short announcement all of Jay&#8217;s accomplishments on behalf of RISD, it is really necessary that more of his service be noted. Therefore below are a number of additional noteworthy activities that Jay carried out during his time at RISD.</p>\n<p>During his time at RISD Jay Coogan has also served on the boards of National Council of Art Administrators, Governing Board of the RISD Museum, Fine Arts Committee of The RISD Museum, Slater Center for Design and Manufacturing, Tapestria, AS220, the RI Salvation Army and the Edgewood Sailing School. He is currently Chair of the Advisory Board of the Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art and was recently elected to the Board of the College Art Association.</p>\n<p>His sculptural work includes the creation of sculptural objects and installations and the making of functional works. He has created public commissions for the cities of Cambridge, MA, Boston, MA, Providence, RI and Green Bay, WI, and also done private commissions for Fidelity Investments, Hasbro Inc. and Zambarano Hospital in RI. His work has been shown at numerous national and international museums and galleries and is represented in many corporate and private collections.</p>\n<p>Jay received his BA from Brown University in 1980 and an MFA from Hunter College in 1982. While in graduate school at Hunter College, Jay Coogan exhibited sculpture work at the Monique Knowlton and Hal Bromm galleries in NYC and at the Jacksonville, Ft. Worth, Indianapolis and Norfolk art museums. He came to RISD immediately after completing his MFA in sculpture in 1982, and in addition to teaching worked for a number of years doing foundry and metal casting work in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Selected one-person exhibitions</strong><br/>\nG Gudewicz Gallery, Bristol Community College, Fall River, MA, 2004<br/>\nHunter Gallery, St. George&#8217;s School, Newport, RI, 2003<br/>\nBankRI, Providence, RI, 2003<br/>\nLenore Gray Gallery, Providence, RI, 1997<br/>\nSalve Regina University, Newport, RI, 1994<br/>\nWheeler Gallery, Providence, RI, 1994<br/>\nHelander Gallery, New York, NY, 1990</p>\n<p><strong>selected one-person exhibitions</strong><br/>\nG Gudewicz Gallery, Bristol Community College, Fall River, MA, 2004<br/>\nHunter Gallery, St. George&#8217;s School, Newport, RI, 2003<br/>\nBankRI, Providence, RI, 2003<br/>\nLenore Gray Gallery, Providence, RI, 1997<br/>\nSalve Regina University, Newport, RI, 1994<br/>\nWheeler Gallery, Providence, RI, 1994<br/>\nHelander Gallery, New York, NY, 1990</p>\n<p><strong>selected group exhibitions</strong><br/><em>3D RI,</em> Newport Art Museum, Newport, RI, 2004<br/><em>H2O,</em> Tiverton Four Corners, Tiverton, RI, 2004<br/><em>Pulp Fiction,</em> French Library and Cultural Center, Boston, MA, 2003<br/><em>Summer Show,</em> Anderson Ranch, Snowmass, CO, 2002<br/><em>A Whole New Space, Sarah Doyle Gallery, Brown University, Providence, RI<br/>\nLa F&#234;te des Cabanes,</em> Nizon-Pont Aven, Brittany, France, 2000<br/>\nVirginia Lynch - A Curatorial Perspective, RI Foundation Gallery, Providence, RI, 2000<br/>\nSuydam + Diepenbrock Gallery, Newport, RI, 2000<br/>\nAcacia Gallery, Gloucester, MA, 2000<br/>\nNew Work, Virginia Lynch Gallery, Tiverton, RI, 1999</p>\n<p><strong>public/corporate commissions</strong><br/>\nFidelity Investments, North Smithfield, RI, 1999<br/>\nFrisoli Youth Center, Cambridge, MA, 1997<br/>\nBradley Children&#8217;s Hospital, East Providence, RI, 1995</p>\n<p><strong>selected collections</strong><br/>\nNeuberger Museum, SUNY, Purchase, NY<br/>\nGoldman, Sachs &amp; Company, New York, NY<br/>\nPaine, Weber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc., New York, NY<br/>\nPrudential Insurance Company, New York, NY<br/>\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA</p>\n<p><strong>education</strong><br/>\nHunter College, MFA in Sculpture, 1982<br/>\nBrown University, BFA in Art, magna cum laude, 1980<br/>\nMontserrat School of Visual Art, Beverly, MA, 1972-73<br/>\nUniversity of Denver, 1969-72</p>\n<p><strong>awards/fellowships</strong><br/>\nFaculty Development Grant, RISD, 1997<br/>\nRunner-up, 3D Art, Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, 1993<br/>\nArtistic Associate Grant, National Endowment for the Arts, 1985<br/>\nGrant for 3D Art, Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, 1984<br/>\nVisual Artist Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1982</p></div>",

    "title": "An Announcement from President Mandle Regarding Jay Coogan"
  }, 
  "72": {
    "content": "<div><p>The news of Jay Coogan&#8217;s transition from his position as RISD Provost leaves an important position for me to consider in the RISD community that I&#8217;ll soon become part of. During the last five months Jay has worked with me closely, as a professor teaching me about RISD and as a generous colleague sharing his deep understanding of what makes this special place sing. I join with Roger in expressing my gratitude to Jay for his dedicated service and many accomplishments as Provost, and I wish him a sabbatical full of creative opportunity.</p>\n<p>I believe that the Provost is with the faculty at the very heart of a school&#8217;s academic mission, and that this person works closely and openly with the President to advance the educational vision of both faculty and students. When I first heard of Jay&#8217;s plans and knowing of his important work here at RISD, I knew that I must be extremely certain about the selection of his successor and that this would be one of the most important decisions that I would be faced with at the beginning of my presidency.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m anticipating my upcoming arrival on campus with excitement and am looking forward to embarking on this new journey with ALL of you. My goal is to make this time of transition as smooth as possible so that RISD&#8217;s excellence continues without pause. At first, I considered searching for a Provost in the context of an international search process across institutions, but after some reflection it became clear to me that the best solution was right in front of me. And, since the Provost is key to the leadership and stability of the academic program at RISD, there was the additional benefit in going forward with an optimal solution before the summer break so that the academic organization can move forward in the best way possible with the least interruption. Weighing the difference between spending a year or more on a search process or having an outstanding new colleague from within RISD from the start made the best choice clear to me.</p>\n<p>Over my past five months of walking the RISD campus, exploring all of its nooks and crannies and listening to a wide variety of faculty, students and staff throughout the campus, one name consistently came to the foreground as a person that &#8220;got&#8221; RISD in a way that one day I hope to achieve. I have observed and admired her careful respect for RISD&#8217;s unique culture and her incredible skill in crafting open, collaborative relationships with faculty and students. With profound respect for <strong><a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/about_profiles.cfm?type=faculty&amp;profile=faculty_profile_65.cfm\" title=\"Jessie Shefrin bio\">Jessie Shefrin</a></strong>&#8217;s exceptional reputation and for all that she has achieved as an artist, educator, and leader, I am honored to announce the appointment of Jessie Shefrin as RISD&#8217;s next Provost. She will assume the position on July 1st, and given her standing in the RISD community and in the academic world at large I am pleased by Jessie Shefrin&#8217;s acceptance of my wish that she work with me and the faculty as the next Provost of RISD.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Dean&#8217;s council Jessie Shefrin has worked collaboratively to advance the educational goals of the college and in creating new interdisciplinary platforms within the graduate curriculum. She has been a strong advocate of strategic initiatives to champion the advancement of teaching and learning across all disciplines and continues to help lay the groundwork for exploring new modes of artistic research by recognizing and supporting the innovative work of faculty and students. Jessie Shefrin has significantly enhanced the venues for exhibiting and promoting the work of graduate students at RISD and has been a tireless advocate for increasing student financial aid. She has been influential in enhancing the graduate identity at RISD and has worked closely with students and faculty alike to help create a vibrant graduate community. This year <em><a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/pdf/usnews_grad.pdf\">U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranked RISD&#8217;s graduate Fine Arts programs #1 in the country.</p>\n<p>Prior to accepting her post as Dean of Graduate Studies at RISD in 2005, Jessie Shefrin was Professor of Print and Digital Media at the School of Art and Design at Alfred University where she taught for 27 years and held a number of administrative roles working with both undergraduate and graduate students. At Alfred she was head of the Foundation Studies Department, the Printmaking Department and the Department of Expanded Media. She co-founded and directed The Institute for Electronic Arts and played a critical role in initiating the Electronic Integrated MFA Program. She is well known for her pioneering work integrating electronic tools and approaches into fine arts curricula. She was the recipient of the prestigious Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Excellence in Teaching, conferred by the State of New York through the State University of New York in Albany, NY.</p>\n<p>Jessie received her BFA from Alfred University and her MFA from the University of New Mexico. She has been a recipient of The New York State Council on the Arts Individual Artist Media Grant and served as a panelist for the New York State Foundation for the Arts Artist&#8217;s Fellowships in Video. Her work has been exhibited widely in this country and abroad including venues such as: P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, Museum of Modern Art affiliate, Long Island City, NY; the European Media Festival, Osnabruck, Germany; The Brooklyn Museum of Art, Brooklyn, NY; and the BS1 Contemporary Art Center, Beijing, China. She has been an artist in residence and has lectured throughout the United States and abroad at many institutions including: The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL; The Wexner Center, Ohio University, Columbus, OH; Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, MI; The Banff Center, Banff, Canada; and The Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing, China. Her work is represented in many collections in the United States including The Philadelphia Museum of Art, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM and in the artist book collections of The Whitney Museum, The Museum of Modern Art, and The Brooklyn Museum.</p>\n<p>On June 1st I will join the community as the 16th president of RISD, and I am delighted that on July 1st Jessie Shefrin will become an integral and complementary part of my leadership team. Please join me in wishing her well in this new endeavor.</p></div>",

In harbor towns like New York and Providence, there is a moment that happens twice a day when the flood tide comes in and hits the ebb tide that is coming down river (the Hudson in NYC, the Woonasquatucket and the Providence River in Providence).  You can see the tides slam together, there is a line of turbulence that marks the old and the new interacting.  Flotsam and debris spin and churn in that current, rising to the top or sinking, shifting around, a twice-daily dance that indicates that the word is still turning and the seas are still moving.</p>\n<p>I have been incredibly lucky, here.  I have had a &#8220;good run,&#8221; as we say in the entertainment biz.  Leaving RISD is bittersweet in a myriad of ways.

        "content": "<div><p>Thank-you John,<br/>\nI asked to begin this strand because I have been rather upset by the waste that is generated at this school, especially at the end of the year. Recently, as I went to throw out my kitchen trash, I was astonished to find a whole array of like-new items sitting in the trash can. I carefully extracted them to find the following:</p>\n<p>3 metal files, looking new and clean;<br/>\nA metal rasp;<br/>\nSmall miter saw;<br/>\n2&#8221;x 4&#8221;x 6&#8221; block of yellow Urethane foam;<br/>\nAn entire Halloween costume, seen at artist&#8217;s ball;<br/>\nA nice winter hat;<br/>\nTwo lightly used books of poetry;<br/>\nA child&#8217;s street rug from Ikea;<br/>\nAnd rather fancy bags to hold it all</p>\n<p>Is anyone interested in these items? I think there could possibly be one or more students who could use the tools, and books should never be thrown away, and if they must be, then they are PAPER recycling&#8230;</p>\n<p>I am disgusted by this callous act by a fellow student living in this building; the level to which this is wasteful is disheartening. If these items were unwanted a simple &#8220;free&#8221; sign on them outside the trash room would have been enough for them to be scooped up, not to mention the numerous resources for donations we all know about; Salvation Army, Goodwill, and now RIDEP (Rhode Island Donation Exchange Program).</p>\n<p>I write this in part because it is shocking to know just what is being thrown into landfills, but also in a hope to educate others about ways in which to prevent this. </p>\n<p>*\t*\t*</p>\n<p>The Second Life Center is organizing an end of the year collection for these and many more items that students cannot keep or need to get rid of. If you have anything that can be used by another person, art student, or community member, PLEASE, do not throw it in the trash this time; bring it to 2nd Life so that someone who wants it can use it. </p>\n<p>More details about the scope of the project can be found at: <a href=\"http://respond-design.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">respond-design.org</a><br/>\nWe are working in conjunction with the Office of Student Life to make this happen, and it is shaping up to save a huge amount of good materials in the coming week. </p>\n<p>STUDENTS: please save everything that can be used and give it to 2nd Life to benefit others less fortunate then yourselves. Look for us this Thursday 22nd, Friday 23rd, and Saturday 24th, at all the major dormitory locations. Please contact 2ndlife [at] risd.edu with any questions.

The class has decided to raise money for 2nd life recycling bins for your departments.  The bins will be just like the bins that you use during move-in and move-out but they will be specifically for recycling supplies that can sent to 2nd life.  Art supplies can be so expensive and why waste them when you know that your classmates could use them later?  </p>\n<p>The Senior Class is hoping to buy 20 bins for all of the department studios, and as many other buildings on campus as we can get bins for, to make it easier to recycle across campus and across departments!  Please help 2nd life and your own department by participating in the 1st Annual Senior Class Gift! John created a challenge at the Senior Class Gift presentation at What We Do that if the Senior Class can raise enough money to buy 5 bins in the next 3 weeks he will buy the 6th bin for you.  The bins are going to cost $250 each and we have jumpstarted the gift already with a gift at What We Do for the first entire bin! We have 3 weeks to raise enough money to buy 4 more bins and I hope that everyone is excited to get behind this for their own department and the entire community!</p>\n<p>More information will be coming soon to the email and campus mailboxes of all Seniors!

Where we are at is that I have made it clear that <i>we are <b>not</b> building a satellite campus in Charlotte.</i> Although Charlotte still seems interested in engaging RISD somehow &#8212; even weakly as they clearly fell in love with our RISD. My feeling is that there is an interest on campus for funded experimental &#8220;design-build&#8221; opportunities as I&#8217;ve heard from Prof. Widder in Architecture. I had a roughly modeled idea based upon how the Serpentine Gallery does in London where they commission an artist to design and construct a large physical installation on-site &#8212; they do one every year I think (maybe a true Brit out there can correct me). Perhaps RISD can think and design large installations locally to be built remotely as an experimental program? Am always on the lookout for creative ideas &#8230; and to be clear, there is no RISD campus being built in Charlotte.  Sorry to be so repetitive on this point. If Charlotte (or any other entity out there) were interested in funding design-build opportunities for RISD talent then that might be a more realistic conversation to have.</p>",

Some of the comments are personally damaging. I have posted the initial results here with artistic license so that folks can get a rough sense for the questions/conversation that is not happening &#8230; but are important ones.</p>\n<p>Thus allow my <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/podcast/080607_what2keep.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">artistic license</a> in removing mostly every reference to a particular unit/person at RISD so that you can see the kind of responses that resulted. In some cases your mind can fill-in-the-blank as to what was originally written. Point is that I have seen everything so for those that wanted to send me a message, it is received. Whether I believe it or not will only happen based upon fact and experience. What you might notice is that everyone loves the faculty and students first and foremost &#8212; me too! I don&#8217;t know a single non-faculty or non-student person at RISD that doesn&#8217;t love the faculty and students so RISD is definitely in the good. Also note in the survey result that some people have different skewed views towards what they believe is true/false about RISD&#8217;s policies towards entry to the RISD community and so forth.

    "content": "<div><p>Last month I received a call out of the blue from <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/04/09/open-source/\">Christopher Lydon</a> telling me that he heard I would not be living in Providence as President of RISD. I thought this to be especially interesting because for one thing, Christopher Lydon is resident at Brown, and secondly, that was the first time I&#8217;d ever spoken with him. Since this conversation with Chris, I&#8217;ve noted in about fifty conversations with faculty, students, and staff a general belief that I will not be living in Providence. So, the easiest way to set things right is to be <i>open</i> about things &#8212; so here I am to be clear on where I am currently at. If I&#8217;m ambiguous in any way it is because I&#8217;m really still trying to figure things out. I may have written a book about <i>simplicity</i> but I know like all of you that real life can be utterly <i>complex</i>. Here we go:</p>\n<ol><li>I do not live in Providence right now. Roger and Gayle will be moving out after Commencement and the Bowen House will probably be ready sometime in July. During the month of August I will be moving myself over in bits and pieces. My means are spare.</li>\n<li>I am moving ahead with the plan on creating a <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/2008/05/09/faculty-gallery/\">Faculty Gallery</a> out of the 1st floor of the Bowen House, and will have living quarters on the 2nd floor. By doing so it will make the Bowen House much easier to engage the community, while at the same time giving me enough privacy to eat a bad pizza and answer emails by myself once in a while. </li>\n<li>I like to cook and engage people &#8212; in general I will probably have potluck style events or &#8220;cook together&#8221; style events with various parts of the RISD and Providence community. This is something I still have to figure out and will approach in the most creative-as-possible fashion. Always open for input and ideas.</li>\n<li>I am going to be very active on campus. I believe I&#8217;ve shown that with my random wanderings into the cafeterias and other spaces at RISD. I don&#8217;t intend on staying in my office as much as possible &#8212; I wish to be one with RISD. The only way to do that is to be out and about. My M.O. is that I&#8217;m always curious about my surrounds and the people that I interact with &#8212; it is what keeps me happy and fulfilled.</li>\n<li>As my mission stated clearly is to raise money for scholarships and academic excellence initiatives, I will also not be in Providence on some days and often on an airplane or other mode of transport. The books all say that a college/university president spends around 60% to 80% of their time fundraising &#8212; so if I&#8217;m here too much at RISD then you might want to be worried (smile). When I am not at RISD physically however, I will always be <i>here</i> online. Ready for any kind of ideas and input that can come my way. I believe I will be literally the most wired president of a college/university in the world. I cannot answer all my individual emails from the community due to sheer volume, nor can I answer all the telephone calls. But I can make a promise that I will be here to answer questions on this blog (and the next blog whatever it might be called .. maybe <i>three?</i>) within at least a 48- to 72-hour turnaround time.</li>\n<li>My commitment to the RISD campus and community I hope is clear: to be accessible physically and electronically more than any other president in the world regardless of geography. And I regret that given the sheer scale of RISD Nation, I cannot dive deeply into any single event so pardon if you see my skittering away to something else &#8212; but I will be doing my best to gorge on as much RISD as physically and mentally possible. Listen to the <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/05/18/my-first-podcast/\">podcast</a> I made yesterday and it will be evidence how much I adore (intellectually) eating as much as RISD has to offer.</li>\n</ol><p>So to recap, I do not live in Providence right now. After the Bowen House clears I will be living there OR in a hotel OR with my family in Lexington. The percentages have not been worked out yet and it will be a moving target. But if you want to know what I&#8217;m doing or thinking, you can always find out here on the blog. Anonymous postings days are on Tuesday so if you want to ask a <a href=\"http://two.risd.edu/anonymous-posting-guidelines/\">civil</a> question I&#8217;m always happy to respond with a civil answer. </p>\n<p>Thank you and have a great end of term, -John</p></div>",

It was a pleasure to work with/for you. In the future I hope to see your names out there in the world working the RISD magic.</p>\n<p>And a big thank you to Mark Moscone.

        "content": "<div><p>Hello All,<br/>\nI wanted to post in with some thank yous and comments on this year&#8217;s Annual Graduate Student Exhibition in the Convention Center. First, thanks to all the grads for a positive attitude and all the hard work that it took to get the show up and running. I think this is the strongest Grad Show I have seen in all my years here at RISD and it&#8217;s important to note the effort that went into it.<br/>\nThe show has been up for over a week now and we&#8217;ve had great response so far. I hope all of you saw the <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/art/content/wk-artscene22_05-22-08_8UA6NSR_v22.252aec8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">article in the <em>ProJo</em></a> last Thursday which really gave a sense of the variety and scale of the different works in the show. There has been a steady stream of visitors so far and this weekend will be busy with the graduation crowd. Remember the show will be open until 8pm on Saturday.<br/>\nMost of you know but some may not realize we&#8217;ve stepped up our advertising this year to include ads on NYC busses on 5th ave and in Chelsea along with ads in <em>ArtForum</em>, the Providence and Boston Phoenixes, Art &amp; Education web posting. I&#8217;m hoping that we will start to build a broader audience for the grads and get them exposure that will help them as they depart RISD and move on to what ever may be next for them.<br/>\nI think it&#8217;s also important to note the attention and work that others put towards making the show happen. Thank you to Gunnar Norquist&#8217;s tireless effort, Jessie Shefrin&#8217;s commitment to the entire show, Jaime Marland, Liz O&#8217;Neil, Liz Leuthner, Eric Meier and many others who contributed.<br/>\nIf anyone has not made it over to see the show I encourage you to do so, it is, as a friend said, an experience that you never get on campus.\n</p><p/></div>",

There are so many things to see, touch, and smell at RISD! The range of activities astounds me, and I am excited to support and promote how the world can learn to adopt &#8220;the RISD way&#8221; of creatively engaging the natural world. </p>\n<p><b>Jessie Shefrin</b> is someone that truly embodies the 21st century ethos of open, collaborative approaches to creating <i>conversations</i> that can become the basis of students&#8217; paths to success as creative leaders in our world. I look forward to learning from Jessie, and to also help place RISD&#8217;s mission of creative learning in every context imaginable. My hope is that all of us together at RISD can acknowledge each of our roles as hybrid teachers-learners &#8212; that we are here to learn from each other, and the habits we model will inform others as leaders. </p>\n<p>One last day of crit-hopping!

Here is his message:<br/>\nWe may not have the grandeur of regal old campus grounds, but the months of May and June bring out the best from the Adams and Eves who tend our tiny Edens. &#8220;Plants are like us, they need food and water,&#8221; said John Andrade as he carefully, even lovingly, established the shrubs on the strip of road between ProvWash and the parking lot. &#8220;My rose bush doesn&#8217;t get a lot of sun,&#8221; I complained to John. &#8220;A little dappled light will do,&#8221; he reassured me kindly.<br/>\nAfter the ceremony of making retired professors &#8220;emeritus&#8221; or &#8220;emerita&#8221; I walked my brother &#8220;Chick,&#8221; who was among the honorees, uphill along College Street. &#8220;Those white roses, they last until the winter. I may cut off the last of the blossoms for my office windowsill,&#8221; I told my colleague, sibling, and once-time boyhood classmate at RISD classes.<br/>\nAnd the reason I&#8217;m writing these words is to thank the gracious and gifted caretakers who make the most and the best of what wee corners of our overwhelmed globalized world are left to us. I commute only a few blocks from my home, whose terrain around and beyond my yard has also been over-tarred, leaving only the gutters at the curbstones. But there too there are those who put in iris bulbs, multicolored gorgeous blooms in the uncertain light of May and June.These often anonymous angels, guardians, messengers are quietly saving the world and I salute them with a humble but beaming smile.\n</p><p/></div>",

With this communication board it seems it will be most beneficial to exclaim amazing experiences and maybe shed some light to some disasters.

How cool would it be to look up professors names and see how they are ranked in relation to each other. I mean they compare us students, and our work, constantly and it makes us stronger and better. So if we colloborate we can hold our teachers up high on pedestals demanding the very best.\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>As I look through past posting from earlier blogs and those on two.risd.edu I see so much excitement over new thoughts and ideas and discussions on how RISD can change for the better.  Of course that is important but, and perhaps I have been here too long, I&#8217;d like to start a thread on what RISD should be careful not to lose.  I&#8217;ve been at RISD since 1988 and it has been more than a home to me.  I started as a figure model, became a student, a teaching assistant, a Pre-College teacher, a prospective parent of a RISD student; currently I am a parent of a RISD student and will within one year will be the parent of a RISD alum.  Now I am a RISD alum and staff person who has worked in Continuing Ed, Fine Arts, and Academic Affairs.  I think that I can safely say that I have had a total and complete RISD education.  </p>\n<p>What don&#8217;t I want to lose at RISD?  First and foremost I want to be certain that we hold on to the easy camaraderie the staff share as fellow workers in a highly intellectual and competitive community.  The stress is high for all of us, but as long as we feel that we are an integral part of bringing RISD&#8217;s magic forward for all to experience, the rewards are even higher.</p>\n<p>I also don&#8217;t want to lose the physical part of RISD, as I really appreciate the odd collection of RISD buildings, most of which were created for one function but changed, quite often in strange ways, as RISD&#8217;s ingenius faculty and staff figured out how to make them work.  I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in danger of this, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to see a corporate sponsor arrive who wants to help move us to newer and better functioning buildings.  Also, I love being in Providence, a small but very vibrant city that is so easy to get around in.  (As long as you&#8217;re willing to walk - public transit could be better, but that belongs on a different blog).</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s just two, and I could go on, but I don&#8217;t want to &#8220;hog the blog&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>What do you think says RISD that you don&#8217;t want to lose?\n</p><p/></div>",

I offer these in a spirit that I hope is similar to the spirit in which you offered yours.</p>\n<p>1. Do no harm. This seems obvious enough, but if you keep in mind that doctors always intend to do good, it&#8217;s interesting to hear it expressed in this way.  Often, harm comes in spite of good intentions.</p>\n<p>2. Get a second opinion. This sounds more like an idea that would occur to the patient, but more than one doctor has made that recommendation to me recently. This requires humility. Of course, any doctor understands that an opinion from a member of his/her own team does not constitute a second opinion.</p>\n<p>I wish you the best as you begin your term as RISD&#8217;s president.\n</p><p/></div>",

I find myself sometimes typing responses and hesitating to submit them, unsure if they belong in such a public space.  For example, I was moved and drawn to the discussion on teaching that emerged with Rosanne&#8217;s post on the furniture faculty&#8217;s process and Sheila&#8217;s beautiful response.  I&#8217;d love to see this section expanded [I guess this is a second request for a thread, although maybe it is more complicated than that].

It&#8217;s a good exercise to be really honest about the actual circumstances of one&#8217;s best learning in the past, or even in the present.  It doesn&#8217;t take too long to realize that we have sometimes learned best from teachers who were dead, even at the time of teaching.  Learning is a field we come to, not something that is brought to us. Or learning is an organ like skin, our presentation to the world.

This means a somewhat tedious session of opening each post, finding whether it has new comments or not, and repeating down the list.

There&#8217;s recently a new vacant storefront that just opened up this year under the mason building and to the left of the CIT entrance that would be just perfect for a new RISD eatery :). I say eatery because it is almost 1 in the morning over here in Paris and I am very tired and it is hard for me to think of something else that would allure people downtown to hang out during the day. It would be nice for the RISD community to branch out, mainly for us undergraduates who our fellow classmates have yet to venture into our studios or even know what exactly Interior Architecture does. And the cries of wanting food on the meal plan closer to us appear to be few since when asking around CIT, very few graduate students have a meal plan. Just a hint, doubtful anything can be done within the next year before I graduate but maybe for future hungry CIT dwellers like me.\n</p><p/></div>",

I guess the repair frightened the ghost into leaving.<br/>\n   Some people claimed to see a ghost in an area. After they left RISD nobody has seen the ghost again.  The buildings are not haunted as many people would like us to beleive. Ghost hunters on tv seems to have a lot of rumors and imaginations running wild.\n</p><p/></div>",

A few months ago, Phil Oliveira from Residence Life showed me a video of the Collab competition and parade.<br/>\nIn decades past, the ID and Architecture departments would split into teams consisting of people of both majors and do an on-site building project at the RISD farm, and almost the entire school turned out to watch. It was sort of a carnival day, with the competition going on at the same time as a cookout and games. Stemming off from that, the students started a tradition of parading around Providence in RISD-style chaos, blaring boomboxes, playing any number of instruments, wearing crazy costumes, ect.<br/>\nI would like to try to bring Collab, or something like it, back to RISD. I feel like RISD has such a wonderful spirit, but there&#8217;s just not enough time or opportunity to express it as much as we&#8217;d like. Are there any people out there who remember Collab? If we were to bring it back, how could we make it a successful, vital part of what RISD is?</p>\n<p>Steph\n</p><p/></div>",

Yet I was even more surprised to see strong parallels to our own I.D. Department such as an extensive machine shop, C.A.D. programs like SolidWorks and Rhinoceros, and even a rigorous drawing course. It seems both departments could benefit greatly by working together, and from talking to various students and professors on both ends, they are eager to take advantage of this opportunity. Have there been joint programs in the past, and how could these two departments (and possibly Architecture too) work more closely together?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Hello,<br/>\nMy name is Alison Tinker. I graduated from RISD this past May and I am currently working full time for Production at PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). When I entered RISD as a freshman, I never would have guessed that I would be here when I graduated. However, I&#8217;ve become enthusiastic about the work (there&#8217;s a lot of it!) and I intend to stay.</p>\n<p>PETA&#8217;s messages have become broader, and even more relevant as the truth about human impact on the environment is being exposed. The urgency of finding a solution to global warming has strengthened our &#8220;Meat Isn&#8217;t Green&#8221; campaign. It presents the fact that the meat industry is causing incredible devastation to the environment and immensely fueling the world&#8217;s food crisis (see [<a href=\"http://www.goveg.com/environment.asp for some compelling info\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a>]). With the addition of several &#8216;green design&#8217; classes at RISD, and the highly attended lecture given by vegan raw-foods expert David Wolfe, I thought that it would be beneficial (not to mention, highly entertaining) if Dan Mathews of PETA could give a talk at the RISD auditorium.</p>\n<p>Dan Mathews is PETA&#8217;s famously creative senior VP. He has recently been touring and promoting his book, &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/feat-committed.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Committed: A Rabble Rouser&#8217;s Memoirs</a>&#8217;, a collection of his amusing adventures and history with PETA. Dan is primarily responsible for making PETA a media magnet, and drawing its millions of members with inventive and artistic demonstrations. His ideas sparked PETA&#8217;s most successful (and most provocative) ad campaign, &#8220;I&#8217;d Rather Go Naked than Wear Fur.&#8221;  In a society constantly bombarded by advertising, it takes a great deal of ingenuity to grab the public&#8217;s attention and change their personal beliefs. But Dan Mathews has done just that. His insights and experience would be very helpful to RISD students whose careers will require them to do the same.</p>\n<p>I was not sure who to send this query to, so I thought I would first attempt to post it here. Please let me know before posting if there is someone I can contact directly. I look forward to your responses. Thank you for your time!</p>\n<p>Alison Tinker\n</p><p/></div>",

The collaboration that occurs between faculty and students is such a crucial part of the RISD experience, it seems like we need to start visually demonstrating this more on the website. </p>\n<p>It would be great to see individual pages that faculty can login to and update themselves with information regarding their teaching and research. Many college and university websites today provide substantial information regarding their faculty in this manner. Currently, the RISD website lists only degrees and email for all faculty; a few faculty have images, but it&#8217;s inconsistent who does. One college website I visited recently even had a page for their students and faculty who blog.  This provided another point of view of the school which is valuable for both prospective students and the school community as well.\n</p><p/></div>",

Tropical storm Hanna will almost certainly pass through Providence this weekend, the weekend new students arrive with their families and many current students return. It is also possible that some portion of hurricane Ike will follow Hanna next week. While at this time Hanna does not appear likely to cause a full blown emergency, we have an emergency management group planning for contingencies. Particular preparations are being made by people in Facilities, Dining, Student Affairs, Residence Life, Public Safety and Media + Partners. Academic Affairs is closely involved. And we are in touch with state and city emergency groups.</p>\n<p>Communications will come in several forms&#8211;there has already been one mass email. There will be email updates periodically. There will be web updates on both RISD.edu and the Intranet. There will be paper postings around campus with phone numbers for help and information. It is possible that the RISD Alert system will be used&#8211;if members of the community have not yet entered their contact information in that system, they should do so. </p>\n<p>The worst effects of Hanna are likely to occur late Saturday and in the early morning hours of Sunday. We urge everyone to practice caution, to keep up with the communications, and to watch out for each other&#8217;s safety. </p>\n<p>I chair the core emergency management team which has members from many different parts of campus. While much good emergency planning has been done at RISD over the years, we will be using the coming year to expand and deepen our plans and to communicate them more broadly. We look forward to periodic communications about the planning and encourage questions and ideas from the community as we go. Meanwhile we ask that everyone become familiar with the emergency preparedness information posted on the Intranet and to be attentive to particular communications about emergency and safety issues this weekend and at all other times.

If so, what do you want to do (and why?) (What does that really mean and encompass, &#8220;programming&#8221;?)</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my one year here, i have noticed the way in which computational projects are somewhat elevated, as if by magic. I can honestly say that the coptic stitch books that suzi cozzens taught me to make have about the same level of difficulty (if not more), but garner less <i>wow</i>.</p>\n<p>To that end, i begin to think that the issue is not one of teaching or learning programming, but instead one of computer literacy or computer science literacy. This summer, katy harris, another graphic design mfa student held an internet information workshop for those in our studio that were interested and it was, by all accounts, a success. It was really just something like: everything you have always been curious about the internet, but have always been too afraid to ask.</p>\n<p>So perhaps my real question is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s clearly a need for more computer knowledge, but to what end? Why should we learn about computers or programming or Processing or Web design? Are we trying to learn a skill or a mindset? To what end?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I invite both students and faculty to respond.<br/>\n&#8211;marcos\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I&#8217;d like to request a thread on teaching and learning. Now that it&#8217;s the beginning of the school year&#8211; at RISD and for our school aged children. This request could be somewhat related to Rosanne&#8217;s observation about the bike drawings. I wonder about the long learning road (from birth to age 17) those high school students took to create such exciting drawings. (I&#8217;m sorry my comments here are so long)</p>\n<p>I had these thoughts after John&#8217;s visit to the Department of Teaching and Learning last night. He had some interesting, and funny things to say to the graduate students, that made me want to comment today. What struck me the most was his comment on &#8220;bad teachers.&#8221; (so maybe this thread could be called Bad Teachers). He said that  the grad students in education here might become good teachers, but some might be bad teachers and that&#8217;s okay. I have always thought that bad teachers are not okay, because what they do is turn off student learning &#8211; poof, system shut down.  </p>\n<p>Well, here are my personal thoughts on &#8220;good&#8221; teaching, with some comments, and I hope others will join. I hope people will also clarify when they&#8217;re talking about learning and teaching young adults and adults as compared to teaching young children because I think the issues are different.</p>\n<p>1. Good teachers look at student&#8217;s minds as multifaceted and evolving like crystals growing in many directions at once. They know that we use both the left and right sides of our brain, and these need to grow together. John said that when he asked parents last week why they are sending their children to RISD, many said it was so their kids learn to be innovative thinkers. In k-12 edu-speak, that translates as &#8220;creative thinkers.&#8221; Innovative/creative thinking involves the power of right brain thinking and employers are respecting that type of thinking these days, says John. Good teachers balance creative thinking (right brain) with skill development and analytic thinking (left brain). The challenge with young children is that they are born great innovators/creative thinkers. In teaching young children, the question becomes how to focus that creative energy, not kill it. (My 4 year old son is the most brilliant inventor of the 21st century)</p>\n<p>2. Good teaching does not involve brain (right or left) thinking only. Good teachers speak from their hearts and teach from what they love and care about. One time a student asked a yoga instructor why he sits on a raised platform to teach, he said &#8220;so you can hear what I&#8217;m teaching from my heart.&#8221; Good teachers care about each and every student, and are passionate about what they&#8217;re teaching.</p>\n<p>3. Good teaching involves an ability to communicate directly, honestly and respectfully to the students. A good teacher can break down a thought, idea, or skill in a way that is clear for the individual student at his or her level.</p>\n<p>4. Good teaching involves creating clear and high expectations for the obligations of the student and the teacher. This could involve expectations for practice but also obligations to themselves, the people in the class, the community and the world. In Judaism there are prayers for almost everything you do, to remind you to be do your obligations, be respectful, help heal the world.</p>\n<p>5. Good teaching involves constant practice on the part of the student and the teacher. As Houdini said when asked how he became a great escape artist &#8220;Practice, Practice, Practice.&#8221;  Good teachers are also practicing professionals. So in the case of art and design teaching (at all levels) they are always practicing their art and design and identify as &#8220;artist educators&#8221;</p>\n<p>6. Know that when you teach you also learn. The greatest artist/designer is one who teaches/mentors and passes on his/her art to others. Unlike the common adage &#8220;Those who teach can&#8217;t do,&#8221; the good teacher as John (I think) said last night  are &#8220;those who teach do.&#8221; I think this means  that &#8220;when you teach something it becomes yours&#8221; In yogic practice, the gurus say that everyone should teach and that is how they become great yogis. By reaching out to others, you better know what you think.\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;d love to take advantage, even superficially, of a broad sweep of what RISD has to offer.  I&#8217;d like to smarten myself up.</p>\n<p>I cringe at the sight of my &#8220;new&#8221; syllabi.  The content is new but the design?  The &#8220;design&#8221; says 1990s!  I&#8217;d like to take a 3-hour intensive class: &#8220;Graphic Design Basics for the RISD Community&#8221;!</p>\n<p>I really need another class: &#8220;Build Your own Website in 3 Hours (or at least lay the foundations).&#8221;  Is there someone here who can teach this, hands on?</p>\n<p>Other short classes I&#8217;d grapple with my schedule in order to take would be &#8220;Color&#8221;; &#8220;What&#8217;s inside those TIAA-CREF envelopes (if you ever opened them)&#8221;; &#8220;Apparel for Teachers (!); &#8220;Principles of Interior Design&#8221;; &#8220;Hands-on Visionary Guide to Media in the Classroom&#8221;; &#8220;Desktop Publishing: Best Hardware, Best Software&#8221; (even this title dates me).  I myself could teach &#8220;How to Write&#8221; (in three hours).  </p>\n<p>This is my shortlist but I&#8217;m sure plenty of people have pressing skill-related needs which this community of experts could begin to meet if we designed a space of exchange. (Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t teach &#8220;How to Write!&#8221;)</p>\n<p>It would be great also to have a regular 1-hour set of classes giving views into each of the departments, and RISD history.  Mike Fink, in my department, is a whole advanced degree-worth of such classes all rolled into one slim frame.  It would be great to have a very social way of exchanging knowledge here at RISD as well as a set of more desperate, time-driven classes for the skill-challenged among us.</p>\n<p>I kind of chuckle at Murphy&#8217;s dilemma: rehearsal at Brown or conversation with John: it&#8217;s an embarrassment of riches.  And I&#8217;m totally down with the sleep thread: sleep is one of my own very favorite activities &amp; I just hate life when I sink into that gritty sub 5-6 hours a night zone.  But it gets old to go from year to year here without really upgrading a range of relevant skills, let alone not enriching one&#8217;s knowledge and understanding of what RISD offers.</p>\n<p>Is there a way for the accumulated skills of this community to potentially upgrade the skills of the individuals in the community?  Is there a way for people who never went to art school or didn&#8217;t even know it was a possibility (like me) to gain access to rudimentary understanding through sophisticated teaching?<br/>\nI don&#8217;t want us all stamped with the RISD brand but it would be great (for me!) if all the printed material I produced looked contemporary and intelligent in terms of design.  Likewise all the hardware/media/programs I use in the classroom: I don&#8217;t think the teacher should be doomed to be behind the curve.  RISD would obviously gain if a bottom-line lingua franca in some relevant fields were available to all.  Sort of like &#8220;No RISDoid Left Behind.&#8221;  Only no punitive measures.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to do it all but maybe there are elementary relevant skills which can be made more accessible to all through a planned and ongoing set of free classes.  Any opinions?  Too much?  Or are people happy going it alone as it is?</p>\n<p>CE already meets most of the needs I outline.  But I&#8217;m thinking of a hammered-together set of courses, RISD 101, taught by RISD faculty, staff, &amp; students, and offered on a continuing, rotating, ever-refinable basis, for the purpose of sharing skills within this community, &amp; maybe lifting capabilities right across the board.</p>\n<p>Mairead\n</p><p/></div>",

I have been with the department for six years now and I remember a time when faculty and staff could use the fitness center 24 hours a day. Public Safety had a sign out key in our office and anyone who wanted to use it could sign a waiver and go to the fitness center. Things have changed over the years and this is not allowed. We have to adhere to the constantly changing hours that the Office of Student Life assigns for the fitness center. Members of the Public Safety Dept. work 24 hours a day. Our job can be very stressful at times and some weeks we could work anywhere from 40 hours to 80 hours. Since some of us practically live here, going to another gym or adhering to the fitness center hours is nearly impossible. Our job demands that we take care of ourselves. We must always be prepared both mentally and physically to help and protect the RISD community. I know that for me going to the gym helps me stay healthy and helps relieve stress. I just wish that everyone in the Department of Public Safety had more time available to do so. At most other public safety departments, whether it be a college department or a municipal department, it is standard policy that their officer&#8217;s be allotted time to work out. We have a great fitness center here at RISD and its right above our office. It just seems a shame that we can&#8217;t use it. I would like to hear everyone&#8217;s opinions on this issue.

Why does RISD not educate its students in even the basic understandings of say, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, or even basic book keeping. i am sure that i am not the only student, given the current economic climate, and following the successes of artists such as Damien Hirst, who advocates the role of business in art, who would at least appreciate the chance to enroll in a course of this type. Furthermore i would really love an answer to why one can transfer credits in maths, social sciences etc. but not in Business Studies<br/>\ni would really appreciate some answers and would love to have the opportunity to discuss these questions with any members of the RISD community.\n</p><p/></div>",

(ie, consistently do not show up for classes, do not complete assignments, etc) and are still allowed enrollment at RISD.  Is it more important that a professor/department ignores problem students (and lets them complete their degree at RISD) so as to keep the number of students in the department up (looks good on paper), or is it more important that a professor/department have the integrity to dismiss the students from RISD?<br/>\nI know my answer, but I wonder if I am missing an integral view on the situation.<br/>\nThanks!\n</p><p/></div>",

While I do think that finding one&#8217;s voice and visual medium is the primary goal of an education here, I do not think that, dare I say &#8220;useful&#8221; design needs to be relegated to ID and Architecture only. Recently the Graphic Design Guild started up as a group of GD students looking to create some extra work around campus and take on somewhat more meaningful projects. I very excitedly joined this group, but even in the first few weeks of its existence there has been a shocking disinterest. Now just a handful of students participate. </p>\n<p>While I am not saying everyone needs to pile on a schedule of work and do-good tasks, I think a lot of the energy devoted to mindless exercises could be used more effectively. Something small- leaving something pretty for a stranger to find and cheer up their day- something that addresses a larger picture. We should not be afraid to attempt what we cannot reach alone, but one person trying inspires others, and even an attempt is better than sitting on the couch all day.  </p>\n<p>We are here to work- that is clear- but we are also here to live, to learn and to work for OURSELVES. I work on my schoolwork as much as I feel is necessary (sometimes hours,  sometimes minutes if that is what I feel needs to be put in) but I always make sure to do something I enjoy- something that challenges me and also just take a break. I feel that using the excuse that you are &#8220;too busy&#8221; to take on something that you are interested in is more of a weakness than a proud assertion. </p>\n<p>Perhaps we all seek the future economic stability- that dotting the &#8220;i&#8221; and crossing the &#8220;t&#8221; will at least yield a paycheck.

I know there&#8217;s already been some talk about class order for registration, but there are a few other issues that I think need addressing and I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;ve all been brought up here. </p>\n<p>The first issue is the number and size of classes in relation to the number of students. It seems the freshman class gets bigger every year, but I haven&#8217;t seen a similar increase in the number of classes offered, or in class size. I&#8217;m a senior, and I found myself shut out of classes I really wanted to take during registration for my final semester in the spring. I can&#8217;t help but feel like this shouldn&#8217;t still be happening. I&#8217;m all for small classes, but there are classes with so few spaces that even seniors can&#8217;t make it in. Maybe we need more sections of popular classes?</p>\n<p>The second issue (and this seems the most problematic to me) is our registration system itself&#8212;WebAdvisor. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve met a single student who doesn&#8217;t absolutely hate this program. WebAdvisor is totally unable to handle a large number of people using it at the same time (which is just what it needs to be able to do) and the server crashes every single time registration begins. Signing up for classes is a nightmare when you might have to spend 45 minutes (like I did today) trying to load pages and logging in and out to get the program to respond so you can try to get into that class with only two spaces left (see issue number one!).  I&#8217;m really not sure what the alternative is (another program?) but I feel that we should look at the systems of other schools to try to find something more functional. </p>\n<p>Thanks!\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>A variety of interested parties at RISD have been discussing and<br/>\nworking on drinking water issues on our campus.  Work from RISD staff<br/>\nstarted with a webinar in August entitled &#8220;Think Outside the Bottle: A<br/>\nWebinar About Bottled Water Alternatives.&#8221;  The webinar presented the<br/>\ncase for replacing bottled water for  tap water (which is safe, abundant<br/>\nand, relative to bottled water, inexpensive.)  The EHS Department at<br/>\nRISD is interested in reducing the amount of bottled water at RISD to<br/>\nsupport a goal of reducing our carbon<br/>\nfootprint.  This is because basically for every gallon of bottled water<br/>\npurchased, about one quart of petroleum product is consumed in the<br/>\nprocess.</p>\n<p>For those interested, more information about the webinar is posted on<br/>\nthe Responsible Purchasing Network at the following website -<br/><a href=\"http://responsiblepurchasing.org.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://responsiblepurchasing.org.</a>  </p>\n<p>After the webinar,  Dining, EHS and Academic Affairs staff, working<br/>\nwith two students decided to hold a<br/>\nwater taste comparison test.  Two sessions were held; one in The Met at<br/>\ndinnertime and again at RISD&#8217;s Benefits Expo - both sessions were also<br/>\nattend by Providence Water Supply Board personnel and the Rhode Island<br/>\nWater Works Association.  Results from the tests indicated that most<br/>\ntasters could not differentiate between unfiltered tap water, filtered<br/>\ntap water and Poland Springs bottled water.  Actually, staff preferred<br/>\nregular chilled tap water over both filtered tap water and bottled water<br/>\ncombined!  Based on that data, we have now moved forward and installed<br/>\n(for trial purposes) two filtered water stations. These filtered water<br/>\nstations filter Providence tap water and then are able to chill or heat<br/>\nfor hot beverages.  Please stop by the second floor of What-Cheer Garage<br/>\nto try the water and voice your opinions and thoughts on these trial<br/>\nsystems.</p>\n<p>For more information on these competitive systems visit<br/><a href=\"http://stonybrookwater.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stonybrookwater.com/</a>  and<br/><a href=\"http://www.coolersmart.com/home.html.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.coolersmart.com/home.html.</a>  Our water group looks<br/>\nforward to hearing from the RISD community.\n</p><p/></div>",

I just was at the Student Alliance meeting where Maeda spoke and after listening to what people were saying about the current status of the school and future goals, one major topic struck me that I dont think has been discussed yet.</p>\n<p>There was discussion about social interactions between majors and how limited it is. I was more concerned with the fact that the academic interaction between majors is slim if not nonexistant. Majors are so separated and flexibility to even just be inspired by other majors regularly is limited to freshmen year.  Artistic fields are becoming more and more interdisciplinary and what is expected of us as students and artists requires a more worldly type of artist than other points in history.  I am not sure that RISD is taking advantage of this change. I can see this separation of majors very clearly in graphic design where we share a building with photography and yet there is no professional discussion or interaction.  I just worry when I hear too much talk about professional training as preparation for the &#8220;real world&#8221; and having that be the main focus for school.  I personally believe that the focus of school, and especially and art school such as RISD, should be about training creative thinkers who are using a material/major as a focus to problem solve think uniquely about art. I have suggestions for how I think that the social/artistic/academic gaps can be jumped but I am hoping that other RISD teacher and students are feeling the same way I am.\n</p><p/></div>",

And if that&#8217;s true, I don&#8217;t have to burden myself with imitation or with soul, but can modestly and simply give you rhythm, in any material whatsoever: bus tickets, oil paints, building blocks, that&#8217;s right, you heard me, building blocks, or words in poetry, or sounds in music, or you just name it.  That&#8217;s why you mustn&#8217;t look too hard at the material; because that isn&#8217;t what it&#8217;s all about.  Don&#8217;t look for some hidden imitation of nature, don&#8217;t ask about expressions of the soul, but try, in spite of the unusual materials, to catch the rhythm of the forms and the colors.  This has about as much to do with bolshevism as a flapper&#8217;s hairdo.  It is, however, the essence of all art, i.e., that every artwork throughout history has had to fulfill this primary requirement: to be rhythm, or else it isn&#8217;t art.&#8221;</p>\n<p>1926</p>\n<p>pppppp; kurt schwitters poems performances pieces proses plays poetics<br/>\neds. jerome rothenberg &amp; pierre joris (cambridge: exact change 2002)\n</p><p/></div>",

Here are the details:</p>\n<p>Title:  Pie-Your-RA<br/>\nWhen:  January 29, 2009<br/>\nWhere:  The MET<br/>\nTime:  6:00-7:00pm - Pie an RA<br/>\n            7:00-7:30pm - Pie a Faculty or Staff Member<br/>\n            7:30-8:00pm - Pie a Friend<br/>\nCost: $1 per pie/ticket</p>\n<p>Description:<br/>\nThis is a charity event where we are trying to raise money for the Rhode Island Food Bank.  It will be a great opportunity for students to have fun, get some entertainment from watching people get pied in the face, and it will also serve as a social opportunity where student get to interact with the RISD community.  We have enlisted some willing souls from the Reslife staff, Office of Student Life staff, and Public Safety officers.  These various participants will be raffled off and one lucky student will get the chance to pie them in the face.  We will be selling raffle tickets on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 6:00-7:30pm at the Met for $1 per raffle ticket.  There will be ponchos provided for protection, paper towels and wet wipes, and the pies will be whipped cream in pie tins.  We were hoping to enlist some more faculty volunteers or just spread the word about the event.  But ultimately we were hoping that John Maeda would be willing to participate.  Let me stress that faculty will only be hit by a pie onces and there will be protections so you will stay relatively clean with the exception of your head.  </p>\n<p>We are expecting a large turn out of both students and faculty as this event and there is almost no doubt that a lot of money will be raised.  I hope we can count John Maeda in on this but if not, I hope he could at least come and watch!</p>\n<p>Best,<br/>\nJessica Wu\n</p><p/></div>",

In the beginning of this school year risd dining made a decision to try and reduce our paper waste and carbon footprint in general. One of the initiatives we started was to require our customers to transfer their food into a to-go container only after they had paid for it. We regularly saw customers eating out of to go containers in the dining room and then throwing them away.  Our thinking was that by inserting a conscious thought into service, folks would make a decision to use a paper to go container only when they were traveling with there food. We also thought that it would be okay to let students living in 15 west take the plates, cups and flatware to their apartments and return them when they were done. That also would help us to be successful in reducing our over all waste.</p>\n<p>We seem to have been wrong on both accounts. What has happened is that the plates have all been taken along with our flatware, plastic tumblers and ceramic mugs that two students worked so hard to make for us last year. And while the paper to-go container use had decreased at first, without plates to put food on for service we were forced to use paper plates or to-go containers, which defeated the whole point. </p>\n<p>So at the holiday break we decided to replenish our china inventory and let our customers receive the to-go container when they order their meal in hopes that they might take that option instead of taking our plates, bowls, flatware, tumblers and mugs. We were very clear all along in our signage and communication to our customers as to our intentions, goals and hardships. Very little has worked and again we find ourselves with no dishes and having to rely on paper plates as we head into second semester.</p>\n<p>As the chef/manager of the portfolio I see my staff working day in and day out with amazing pride, ownership and skill in providing the best experience that they can for our customers and our school as a whole. While you may not always agree with our decisions, they all come from the heart and are meant to be positive and have an important impact both on how we are perceived and our role in the community and the world. </p>\n<p>What I am asking is for is a dialog with all of you to help me solve this problem. We want our dishes, we need our dishes. Please take the time to bring them back to us or help us find an alternative solution.  Please help us</p>\n<p>tim\n</p><p/></div>",

The loan amount beyond tuition and fees is refunded to us, and in the case of many students, is used for studio materials (very expensive), rent, food etc. There is a gap, however, between when the semester starts and when refunds are issued that leaves many of us flapping in the wind while we wait for the money we have borrowed to use for our education, and watch part of our semester tick away in futility. </p>\n<p>Federal laws prohibit loans from being dispersed ahead of their arrival (logical), but the system once they arrive leaves something to be desired. Refunds are issued either 1 or 2 weeks after the semester starts because of a policy that checks are cut but once a week. In the case of this semester, school starts on the 16th and checks will be cut either on the 20th or the 27th. This leaves a potential gap of 11 very important days at the beginning of ones semester without an oar to paddle. 11 days may not seem like a lot but consider that its the equivalent of 10% of the semester. In tuition dollars ( roughly $13,000 a semester) this means that an investment of $1,300 is significantly compromised.</p>\n<p>I believe that it is more than worth the cost of these hefty loans to be here. RISD is a fantastic education. I would like to suggest that we remedy problems like this in the spirit of making it better. I hate imagining that like me, there are students &#8220;waiting around&#8221; for loan refunds while their educational opportunities pass by. I would suggest more aggressive refund check issuing during these periods (beginning of Spring and beginning of Fall). Thanks for any feedback!\n</p><p/></div>",

Let me also be clear that I am referring to non-Hollywood DVDs that I use for my classes.</p>\n<p>The easy solution to this has in fact crossed my mind: just return the darn movies on time or renew them online.  Everyone makes mistakes from time to time though, especially hard-working, time-strapped RISD students and we deserve better than to be slapped with $15 in fees for keeping three DVDs an extra day, whatever the reason.</p>\n<p>I would like to point to Media Resources&#8217; lending policy as a suggestion for compromise, which loans far more coveted and valuable items than DVDs.

I guess I am interested in having a discussion about the way faculty feel about sharing their syallabi and projects. I have begun blogs recently for two of my classes and we are all in the spirit of sharing. I imagine that I will be adding bibliographies, my weblists, interesting links, as well as my project briefs, images, etc: pretty much everything I have researched in preparation for my classes will appear on the pages of these blogs. People teaching in classes in other institutions are free to use these links/ideas/information. That&#8217;s good, right? I know some faculty copyright their syllabi and project descriptions because it can be frustrating to work so hard on designing and developing project briefs and criteria, only to find that someone somewhere else has &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the project description and is attempting to teach it in a different, possibly less considered, way. Also grad students occasionally move on to teaching straight out of grad school and they too will often use projects that derive straight from the ones they were given while in school. I don&#8217;t feel strongly about this one way or the other, but I am curious about what others think. What is the feeling about this in the RISD community? (is there already a thread about this?) The web has of course totally altered the feeling of community property out there, and I know that sharing is the new paradigm. And I am all for sharing (I think). Are you?\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>Liz,<br/>\nAfter our divisional meeting with John and Jessie today, I have a new thread. I would call it &#8216;The Difference Between the Lightning Field and the Very Large Array Telescope&#8217;. It goes like this:</p>\n<p>I visited New Mexico with an art historian friend about 10 years ago. We spent a night in the cabin at Lightning Field, without lighting. There is never lightning, because the metal rods at the same height create a field, not points, in the desert. Lightning strikes points, and not fields. It is an instrument for measuring a sublime landscape, but by virtue of its measured precision, it points only to the sublime as not measurable. It speaks to the problem of too much.</p>\n<p>The Very Large Array telescope is on a plateau elsewhere in New Mexico. It is a giant radio telescope covering acres on train tracks, absorbing endless amounts of information from outer space. So much information, in fact, that even if all of humanity were to live for eternity, all the incoming signals could never be &#8220;seen.&#8221; But by virtue of endless gathering, to scientific ends, it can never acknowledge the problem of too much, because measure and hierarchy cannot be thought at the same time as the democratic, content-neutral gathering of information that the VLA telescopes is built to accomplish.</p>\n<p>So:<br/>\nwhat I miss at RISD is not the ideas and desires, but rather a cogent way of acknowledging that those are infinite. Are we Lighting Field or Very Large Array? Are we gathering information under the postulate of neutrality and non-hierarchical study? Or are we working empirically, towards as set of provisional conclusions as a way of reducing the number of variables, aiming towards an outcome, contextualizing our thinking - and (something critical theory did at least a hundred years ago) recognizing the belief in value-neutral information gathering as its own particular blind spot?</p>\n<p>too obscure?\n</p><p/></div>",

Long Live the Art!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m curious to hear comments about the whole piece, and this bit especially:<br/>\n&#8220;Art schools can change too. The present goal of studio programs (and of ever more specialized art history programs) seems to be to narrow talent to a sharp point that can push its way aggressively into the competitive arena. But with markets uncertain, possibly nonexistent, why not relax this mode, open up education? Why not make studio training an interdisciplinary experience, crossing over into sociology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, poetry and theology? Why not build into your graduate program a work-study semester that takes students out of the art world entirely and places them in hospitals, schools and prisons, sometimes in-extremis environments, i.e. real life? My guess is that if you did, American art would look very different than it does today.&#8221;\n</p><p/></div>",

        "content": "<div><p>I would like to respectfully request a new thread on the financial crisis RISD now faces. I am a RISD Staff member who would like to see RISD save in places where it will mean the most. I am fearful, as are many others staffers I have spoken with over the course of the past month. Loss of employment is the utmost fear in the hearts of many, but coupled with that fear is the unrelenting waste seen on campus, as well as the continued spending from places such as the museum.<br/>\nWhile we are all in total understanding of a museum needing to provide new displays for those who wish to peruse their halls, there remains a gross lack of funds with which the college is operating. The museum has, in its collections and cases, artifacts, items and baubles that have not been seen in the museum hallways in years. Why are we paying for climate controlled, dry, damp, cool, warm housing for the artifacts? Why do we not revolve our museum inventory in an effort to have the museum actually show an operational &#8220;break-even&#8221;? The museum has run over budget as many years as I have been employed at RISD. If we are going to purchase and display new and wonderful procured art, shouldn&#8217;t we sell / share what has not seen the light of day in literally years?<br/>\nWhy are departments on campus allowed to claim space that is now not being used efficiently? Why are we not utilizing 10 Westminster St. when we are still paying the lease? Where has the brainstorming gone?<br/>\nI used the museum as an example - not a target; I voiced questions that have been posed to me along with questions of my own. I prefer nitty-gritty to smoke and mirrors and hope that the hard questions finally get asked before jobs are put on the line.<br/>\nAny higher education institution must have a system of checks and balances - I see few out of many making good choices to help RISD. However, in the same moment, I can see those who feel as though RISD should be operating as it did 10 years ago and are unwilling to budge from their belief - or raise a finger to help in the current crisis.\n</p><p/></div>",

In particular, cigarette butts are all over the place, on all the sidewalks, outside of buildings, and in the gutters.  Until some designer or scientist designs a toxin-free, biodegradable filter, those things are trash.  As a former smoker who struggled for years to break free of this insiduous habit and addiction (I quit 6 years ago) I find it sad to see all the young kids hanging out smoking, then tossing their butts on the ground.   I don&#8217;t think it looks good for our school and it&#8217;s definitely not good for the environment.</p>\n<p>So you can&#8217;t make everyone quit.<br/>\nBut can we at least get some of those cigarette butt disposal chimney things for outside of the buildings where people smoke?  Can we encourage smokers, especially students, to hang on to their butts if there is no place to dispose of them?

The unprecedented upheaval in our financial worlds, from the largest institutions to individual families, is making it much more uncertain than normal to predict what road students will follow with their college choices in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>It seems this year that many private colleges (more expensive) have seen declines in their applicant pools while most public institutions (less expensive) are experiencing increases.  At RISD, our freshman applicant pool this year is currently 2817 students; last year at this time it was 3149 (a record number) and before that it was 2764 for 2007 and 2553 for 2006.  So, this year we are down vs last, like most privates, but have our second highest number of  freshman apps.  </p>\n<p>For graduate applicants, we&#8217;ve experienced a significant increase this year.  We now have 2145 applicants versus 1676 last year and 1724 and 1721 in the two prior years.  It seems many people see this time of diminished job options as their moment to pursue new educational opportunities.</p>\n<p>We are hoping that the excellent education offered at RISD will continue to assure admitted students and their families that the significant investment of effort and personal resources is well worth it.  We are pretty certain, however, that reaching a decision to attend a more-expensive private college will be particularly hard for many students this time around and will continue to be a major, and growing, factor in college choice in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Ed Newhall<br/>\nDirector of Admissions\n</p><p/></div>",

And for what??</p>\n<p>My father has been trying to get in contact with someone in the administration (not sure who) but has not heard back from anyone - and he has contacted them several times.

Specifically for graduation, the only things I know that the money is for are the caps and gowns; other than that, I speculate it is for the catering afterwards, tents, speakers, and the reservation of a PARKING LOT (and from what I have heard, a lot/building that RISD owns?) for the ceremony.</p>\n<p>It concerns me that after being here for almost 5 years, we are still being asked to pay a lot extra to finish.

The film follows five women artists as they navigate the economic, psychological, and spiritual challenges of making work outside the elite art world. From Hawaii&#8217;s Big Island to the suburbs of Ohio, from New York City to the deserts of New Mexico, we watch as these women&#8212;ranging in age from 27 to 65&#8212;fight to honor their vision and their families every day. </p>\n<p>Interviews with experts like Riane Eisler (The Chalice and the Blade), Maura Reilly (Sackler Center for Feminist Art-Brooklyn Museum) and the Guerrilla Girls add a cultural context for these women&#8217;s uplifting journeys.

        "content": "<div><p>This may be a controversial topic, but I&#8217;d really like to see a discussion about the use of live animals in art projects at RISD. </p>\n<p>Personally, I have been disturbed by what I&#8217;ve seen of students buying an animal or multiple animals to be used live in an art piece (be it a photograph or a performance), with little or no regard for the safety and comfort of the animal. I&#8217;ve worked at the Nature Lab for two and a half years, and in that time I&#8217;ve seen some of these animals (particularly fish) dumped at the Nature Lab after the students are &#8220;done&#8221; with them. We then have the task of trying to care for these unexpected (and stressed) animals, which we may or may not have room for, when in my opinion they really ought to have been bought by people who would actually care for them and keep them instead of being somebody&#8217;s disposable &#8220;art.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d actually like to see a RISD policy dictating a code of ethics for using animals in work. I know nobody wants policies telling them what they can and can&#8217;t do with their art&#8212;I&#8217;m against censorship too&#8212;but to me this is a little bit different. Now, I&#8217;m not seeing anyone torturing or starving dogs here at RISD (look up the story on Costa Rican artist Guillermo Vargas), but in my opinion, buying an animal, subjecting it to a stressful environment, and then abandoning it is still cruel and unnecessary, even if it&#8217;s a goldfish. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m okay with people taking photos of wild animals or pets as long as the animal isn&#8217;t being hurt or stressed (which CAN cause physical damage). I&#8217;m okay with using animal remains in artwork (I often use salvaged animal parts in my work, the operative word being salvaged). I&#8217;m not okay with somebody treating an animal like a prop, and I&#8217;m definitely not okay with that animal then being abandoned. </p>\n<p>The question is, if we did create a policy regarding the ethical treatment of animals in art pieces, how would we enforce it, and how could we write it carefully so as to permit people to still take photos of animals or possibly even use animals in performance pieces, as long as they are treated with respect and cared for, while cracking down on real animal abuse and neglect?\n</p><p/></div>",

Now I am genuinely interested in gaining further insight into how the library hours come to be at RISD.</p>\n<p>I remember when I was an undergraduate computer science student, the library and the computer clusters were the two main places of focus when it came to engaging in academic work. The computer clusters, which I now realize were akin to studio spaces, were open 24 hours, and the library was open until 3am. When it came close to finals, the library was open 24 hours. This was fantastic! </p>\n<p>To me, the library was not only a place where you could go find books or find a desk to read at. It was a place where you can discover ideas you&#8217;d never thought of, get inspired by them in ways that you never thought possible, and make relationships among them that you didn&#8217;t know existed. It was a place where you could think in ways that were somehow __different__ from the ways you would think in your room or in a computer cluster. You could watch other people read, and you may find yourself wondering what they are reading. Maybe you&#8217;ll even ask them about it. At a library you can not only read and think, but write. You may find it to be more fluid than if you were in a different location. All the while you never feel the time pass by because you become completely immersed in your search. For some odd reason this was __the__ space that allowed me to do all these things effectively. It is only after I learned about the idea of &#8220;design&#8221; that it became clear to me. This space was __designed__ this way.</p>\n<p>Yes, it may perhaps have promoted the culture of students working overly long hours in these two locations. Yes, this was probably unhealthy for the students. Yes, these students may have been inefficient. Yes, these students may have not only been working but chatting with their peers. But none of these can denounce the fantasticness, if that is a word, of this purposefully designed space known as the &#8220;library&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I wonder what kind of effect RISD can have on students by simply changing the library&#8217;s hours of operation? What if it were open until later? I&#8217;m most certain this is a subject of tremendous interest to the entire RISD community.</p>\n<p>slim<br/>\n&#8212;&#8212;<br/>\nSeung Chan is my full first name, and yes it has a space in it.\n</p><p/></div>",

A number of events coincided to prompt this project, including inspiration provided by RISD President John Maeda, who consistently encouraged RISD students to charge of their school and shape their community. </p>\n<p>A handful of seniors came together to brainstorm ways to give back to RISD, from which a &#8220;green idea&#8221; began to emerge.  The Class of 2009 would reduce RISD&#8217;s waste removal costs by expanding the scope of its new 2nd Life program, a student-run recycling program that reuses and repurposes art materials before they head off to an industrial recycling center. </p>\n<p>2nd Life is a growing resource for RISD students, made possible by the continuous support of the Office of Student Life. Currently, students bring their left over materials to the 2nd Life trailer located along the riverfront. But for many students this has been a difficult process due to the quantity or size of the materials, or the distance they must be carried.  Enter the Class of 2009 Senior Gift. </p>\n<p>Seniors struck upon the idea of a system of bins, one for each studio building, that would make repurposing materials easier, thereby expanding 2nd Life&#8217;s reach significantly. The bins would allow students to collected materials &#8220;locally,&#8221; then put them into the larger system of 2nd Life through these bins. </p>\n<p>RISD President, John Maeda, so liked the idea that he challenged the senior class:  raise enough money for five bins in three weeks and he&#8217;ll buy the sixth bin out of his own money. Tomorrow senior leaders have invited President Maeda to the Student Alliance meeting to reveal where they are in the challenge.  (Hint: They told him to bring his check book.)</p>\n<p>To learn more about Senior Gift and 2nd Life, or to watch John Maeda write a check for the Senior Class Gift, be at the Carr Haus Tap Room tomorrow (May 6th) at 6 pm.</p>\n<p>For more information on The Senior Class Gift, email <a href=\"mailto:risdseniorgift@gmail.com\">risdseniorgift@gmail.com</a>.\n</p><p/></div>",

Our materials are cut by us to the square inch, square foot, or board foot, depending upon the request of the person ordering. They are fortunate to only have to pay for what they require.  Remainders of the materials are selected by us to be cut optimally for the subsequent orders.  Pieces too small to be re-shelved within the large sheet racks are held in scraps for sale bins. These pieces are not as small as to be considered true scrap. i would estimate that one percent of our  total sheet and board materials become too small for purchase and are offered in our hallway free bin. Every piece is taken by someone, each and everyday. Artists I would imagine.\n</p><p/></div>",

And don&#8217;t forget that Jack Lang, former (and probably coolest)French Minister of Culture, created a &#8220;scandale&#8221; in 1995 when he showed up at a general assembly meeting in a Mao style jacket created by Issey Miyake.</p>\n<p>Cool Biz campaign<br/>\nThe Japanese Ministry of the Environment (MOE) began advocating the Cool Biz campaign in summer 2005 as a means to help reduce electric consumption by limiting use of air conditioning. This idea was proposed by then MOE minister, Yuriko Koike under the Koizumi cabinet.</p>\n<p>According to the Environment Ministry, central government ministries were to set air conditioner temperatures at 28&#176;C until September. The Cool Biz dress code advises workers to starch collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from materials that breathe and absorb moisture. </p>\n<p>Additionally, workers are encouraged to wear short sleeved shirts without jackets or ties. </p>\n<p>All of the government leaders practiced Cool Biz. Prime Minister Koizumi was frequently interviewed without a tie or jacket, and this produced a significant advertising effect.</p>\n<p>Result of Cool Biz Campaign</p>\n<p>On October 28, 2005, the MOE announced results of the Cool Biz campaign. Survey results indicate that 95.8% of respondents knew Cool Biz and 32.7% of 562 respondents answered that their offices set the air conditioner thermostat higher than in previous years. Based on these figures, the ministry estimated that the campaign resulted in a 460,000-ton reduction in CO2 emission, the equivalent volume of CO2 emitted by about 1 million households for one month. The results for 2006 were even better, resulting in an estimated 1.14 million-ton reduction in CO2 emission, the equivalent to the CO2 emissions by about 2.5 million households for one month.</p>\n<p>The ministry has also stated that it intends to continue encouraging people to set summer office temperatures at no lower than 28&#176;C as well as work to have the Cool Biz concept take permanent root in society.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Elizabeth\n</p><p/></div>",

I&#8217;m surprised to find myself rising at 6:00 a.m. (I&#8217;m not an early riser, so this really is a miracle) so that I have time to water every morning, while at the same time enjoying the early morning smells and the birds singing.

Why am I so surprised by these warm feelings?

With this communication board it seems it will be most beneficial to exclaim amazing experiences and maybe shed some light to some disasters. Although it will be a highly subjective, it will give students an enlightened entry when they sign up for classes. How cool would it be to look up professors names and see how they are ranked in relation to each other. I mean they compare us students, and our work, constantly and it makes us stronger and better. So if we collaborate we can hold our teachers up high on pedestals demanding the very best.</p></div>",

But the rival typography professor next door was in, and for some reason he asked me to come into his office. He shut the door.</p>\n<p>I was just beginning to receive some acclaim for my work, and perhaps that precipitated this professor&#8217;s need to sit me down for 30 minutes to yell at me and repeatedly say, &#8220;You will never amount to anything.&#8221; Granted I was pretty winded after the experience, but I realized that this episode help to make me stronger. (Cue Christina Aguilera&#8217;s <i>Fighter</i> music here &#8230;) Not saying that this professor should have been commended for his poor attitude of course. But it made me realize how even a negative experience becomes one to learn from. Even though in one sense I&#8217;d rate him the worst teacher imaginable, I know that I&#8217;d have to rate him as the best one I ever had as well. </p>\n<p>One thing I would suggest students to consider is that all experiences of learning are good ones. And depending upon how you look at them, they can even be considered <i>great</i> ones. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s all about <i>you</i> and what you do with anything that comes your way. The greatness inside you is what ignites the learning experience. My conversation with freshman (now rising Sophomore) Miguel in <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/05/27/crit-week-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this podcast</a> shows a student perspective in a powerful light.  </p>\n<p>Great teachers are abound in life. It always depends upon how you approach each learning experience. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like some learner&#8217;s inspiration, I suggest you look at what Yo-yo Ma says of <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/01/28/beyond-education/\" rel=\"nofollow\">education</a>, and what Randy Pausch says about <a href=\"http://our.risd.edu/2008/04/06/randy-pausch-my-last-lecture/ rel=\" nofollow=\"\">education.</a> All the secrets for deep learning are right there.

        "content": "<div><p>Yesterday I was baking a cake for our faculty curriculum colloquium. We meet annually to look at the past year, and talk about the effectiveness of the curriculum, specific projects assigned, the student exhibitions we devised, sponsored research projects, events, etc. By reflecting on the past year, we determine what we want to put in place for the year ahead. We have found that this is a key factor in keeping the curriculum relevant and dynamic. Every year the students change, the fields expand, new technologies play a different role, new materials impact our discipline(s), markets shift and grow more complex, and WE learn, grow and change as faculty and practicing artists/designers. To move forward without paying attention to all these factors might make the curriculum stagnant, or worse, reverting backwards. We also find that talking openly about practice at each level of learning with each other helps us to integrate goals and expectations for subsequent years in a way that challenges the students while ensuring that the sequencing of the degree programs makes sense.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the cake. While cutting up some rhubarb to fold into the batter, I found myself adjusting the angle of the knife, and re-positioning the orientation of the crisp red stalks on the cutting block. Intuitively, I heard Frid, my teacher from RISD a long time ago, teaching me how to cut something cleanly and efficiently. No matter that he was talking about wood with saws or chisels, the message was the same. The points that he showed me could be applied to &#8211;well even rhubarb. All these years, and admittedly its been a few, I still carry these lessons from my years at RISD with me. My best teachers voices are ingrained in how I think and in decisions I make every day.</p>\n<p>I thought about this as we worked on the curriculum and ate the cake together as a faculty. I thought about Jennifer&#8217;s comments, and about how it really isn&#8217;t about faculty being judged, or rated, it&#8217;s about our roles as faculty teaching a way of thinking that can be applied to the work at hand, or the challenges one faces every day putting a life together BEYOND making a piece of work. Any deliberate act of judgment can draw on experience from lessons learned from deliberate making. If, as a teacher, I worried about how a student judged me I would be missing the point and perhaps even shying from the risk I might need to take to get a student to think differently about something. Sometimes risk-taking is a big factor in breaking through with a stuck student, and one of the scariest parts of teaching.  </p>\n<p>My teachers continue to teach me long after they are gone, even some whom I criticized for something at the time. The ultimate honor of teaching is in hoping that someday, thirty years down the path, one of your students will think about something with a little more wisdom or elegance, or certainty, because you opened a path for them at the right moment in their lives; even if it manifests with proficiency in doing a simple task, like baking a cake.\n</p><p/></div>",

What you say makes me think also that communication challenges at RISD are not just general but specific: between teacher &amp; student, or between the members of a department.  And those arenas are very within reach.  </p>\n<p>To flip your last paragraph:  I&#8217;m kind of ashamed to say how much I learn from students.  Often, since I&#8217;ve been at RISD, a student mentions something: a text, or an idea or movement, &amp; I just know it&#8217;s what I need &#8212; so I seize it &amp; make it part of a course.</p>\n<p>I remember, when I was a substitute teacher in Ireland, walking up &amp; down the aisles of a classroom, &amp; stopping to listen to a student who was explaining the design of a wind-powered machine of some kind (it was a long time ago) to a fellow-student.  I asked him a few questions, &amp; he questioned me back: &#8220;Why are you asking me questions?&#8217;  I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m interested.&#8221;  And he said: &#8220;Well it&#8217;s not my job to teach you!&#8221;  </p>\n<p>His comment eventually, years later, sunk into my practice enough to help me make a u-turn &amp; be more willing to *teach* in the classroom, instead of always trying to learn.

It would have been easy for Lane Myer (the faculty member in charge of us, poor man) or for Jessie or Rosanne to step in, hand us a chart and a compass, and say &#8220;Go over there.&#8221;  In fact, there were times that we begged for that.</p>\n<p>But because they showed restraint, and because they trusted us to make our own compass and draw up our own chart, the whole class (at least for me) shifted from an exercise in market research to a learning experience of the first order.  That line in my speech about a way of thinking that is non-linear and agile came directly from what happened in that class.  What we were learning to do was to communicate, to work across boundaries, to feed off of each other&#8217;s creativity, and to do all of this in a respectful and trusting way.</p>\n<p>Now that&#8217;s a lesson I am sure I will not soon forget.</p>\n<p>z\n</p><p/></div>",

It&#8217;s notable how we demand teaching degrees for K-12, but in colleges and universities there really are no teaching accreditations. We&#8217;re sort of dumped into the classrooms/studios and expected to &#8220;figure it out.&#8221; Students may be abhorred by hearing that, but it&#8217;s been done like that since the beginning. The beauty of it all, as Sheila points out, is that when a professor grows together with his/her students &#8212; that&#8217;s where *true* deep and spiritual learning takes place. This has nothing to do with age or experience of course. One of my favorite stories is how a black belt in Karate is truly a master when after years of wearing the black belt, it returns to white due to wear and tear. Essentially the master erases his/her status to adopt the stance of being a beginner again &#8212; a true master yearns to learn anew. Thanks, John\n</p><p/></div>",

You then meet with them for a review, discuss your strengths and weaknesses, etc.</p>\n<p>This was truly significant moment for me. For the first time I was able to see myself as my students and colleagues do, and guess what I learned? </p>\n<p>1) It was fascinating to see the little things, like how much I move around, and how sometimes I start talking about something and turn away from the class as I am doing it, thereby preventing them from hearing me as I continue a statement.

It was a very different experience than reading student evaluations and Annual Reports, and responding to my own constant inner assessor and critic.

For example, although a middle-aged white man in a suit may still be a default image, there is some awareness of assumptions one is making, and also some contest.  Liz was saying how marvelous it is, in Providence say, with brilliant intellectuals/researchers from all over the world, to realize that the down-at-heel looking guy next to you at Coffee Exchange, or the slightly frumpy middle-aged woman, might be incredible stand-out thinkers &amp; doers internationally.   The same goes for ways of talking.  Important things aren&#8217;t necessary said in important ways right now.  They don&#8217;t necessarily announce themselves as important, though they can.  They can also be colloquial, almost casual, even fun.</p>\n<p>In another conversation, we have been talking about metaphor: How do we imagine our relationship to RISD?  As a family?  As a marriage?  As a slot-machine that delivers a paycheck?  (Yes!)  How do our metaphors for the workplace affect behavior.  For example, I would argue that the more we understand RISD as a family, the more our actual family recedes into the background, i.e., metaphors displace &#8220;reality,&#8221; or kind of strip-mine the identity of the &#8220;lenders,&#8221; though the process can eventually be productive for both, with both the borrower &amp; lender gathering identity.</p>\n<p>Another conversation, also with Liz, about student/teacher identities.  Liz was a RISD student, and is an alum, and professor.  How does that complex transition work?  How does it affect her understanding/relationship with students, &amp; also with former professors, now colleagues?  This led me to think about the roles we play in the classroom.  I tend to be (I think) a solicitous teacher, while I&#8217;m not solicitous at all in a performance context outside RISD.  I&#8217;d kind of like to move from &#8220;Tell me about it&#8221; toward more of a &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste my time unless you can dazzle me&#8221; mode!</p>\n<p>Are there default roles we adopt as student or teacher, which narrow the range of the possible?  Do you move easily between roles, here at RISD, inside or outside the classroom?  Would it be bracing to really challenge our notions of the role(s) of teacher, or to display a rich range of them?  How about students?  I often feel students agree to be less than they are in the classroom.  RISD students tend to be fantastically polite &amp; sweet.
