      <h2>a casual resume</h2>
      <p>People often ask me, "what do you program in?" The answer these days is either 'python' or 'javascript.' For a while it was 'lisp' or 'ruby' and for another brief while it was 'matlab' or 'java.' when i was younger, the answer was 'php' and 'sql.' before that, though, i would say 'basic' or 'c'. although nobody really asked me back then.</p>
      <p>I have been lucky enough to mostly program in very high level languages (scheme included), so i have missed out on the joys of malloc or clearing out registers or pretty much anything like that. i have written code for a pic, but i wouldn't say that i know how to program for any architecture, as everything i do seems to be pretty portable</p>
      <p>I took mit's teacher education program during which time i observed at cambridge rindge latin + science, buckingham brown + nichols middle school and student taught at arlington high school. As i was not planning on teaching secondary school in the near future, i did not pick up a credential.</p>
      <p>Before i graduated from MIT, i worked as a line cook or 'chef garde manger,' at 400 Highland in davis square. I worked with some really talented folks: seth amsden, kim prue, andrew bridge, zach lord, and briefly mike penna. The experience made me a better cook than i ever imagined. I stopped working there to start doing full time graphic design work.</p>
      <p>While i started doing graphic design work, i began teaching html, css and other random web technologies at the center for digital imaging arts at boston university.</p>
      <p>That's about it, except for the fact that i'm going to grad school in the fall to pursue an mfa in graphic design. woo!</p>
