        <p>I recently bought a manual typwriter and realized when i was
        researching it that there were only two resources on the web that
        described my typewriter in any way shape or form. </p>
      
        <p>Here is my addition to those two, a <a
        href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2004/0105_tap_tap_tap.php">
        blog posting</a> and a <a

          <p>The Lettera 35l is a fully manual typewriter. It has no memory, so
          the keys are prone to jamming if you type too quickly.  Otherwise,
          the machine is excellent. Having grown up primarily using a computer
          or word processor, i was slightly unprepared for some of its quirks.
          </p>

          <p>My first exposure to the Lettera 35L was in Derek Birdsall's
          "Notes on Book Design." In the book, he describes one of the
          lettera's most enjoyable features: its numbers. The numbers are
          old-style text figures which dip below the baseline. In the lettera,
          the effect is subtle and not as exaggerated as in some fonts.
          Curiously, the one number that i did not locate was the 1. In true
          old fashioned style, the L doubles as a 1.</p>

        <h2>features</h2>
      
        <img src="images/lettera-color-switch.jpg" 
          alt="ribbon color selector" />
        <img src="images/lettera-tabstop-clear.jpg" 
          alt="tabstop clearing mechanism" />
        <div class="copy">
          
          <p>The lettera has a few, well implemented features. These include a
          settable tab stop, a two color ribbon, an automatic single, double
          and triple spacing option and a set of rabbit ear paper holders. All
          in all, it is very nicely designed.</p>

          <h3>Color</h3>

          <p>Changing the color that you type in is straightforward. The spool
          has two colors on it. The black is on the top and the other is on the
          bottom. You can switch between the colors by lifting the switch on
          the right side. After one or two tries the motions are purely
          subconscious. The mechanism works by lifting the ribbon so that the
          right part of it is impacted by the keys.</p>

          <p>The only problem with this setup is that it does not take the
          standard Smith-Corona ribbons which are slightly too fat. The only
          fix that i can really see is to just suck it up or buy a proper
          ribbon from <a href="http://www.nukote.com">Nu-Kote</a>. The proper
          item numbers are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>B53 - Black Nylon</li>
            <li>BW277 - Black Nylon with White Correcting Tape</li>
            <li>NK277BR - Black/Red</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The only thing to note is that you should be careful with are the
          original spools that came with your lettera, if any did come with it.
          The Smith-Corona ribbons are too small to fit in the typewriter, so
          you are forced to use the proper ribbon. Because the smith-corona
          ribbons are more readily available, you will probably find yourself,
          as i did, spooling the new ribbon onto the old spools.</p>
          
          <h3>Tab</h3>
          
          <p>By raising the left switch (the second image) and pushing the red
          tab button, you can set the tab stop at the current location on the
          line. To clear the tab, you hold the blank key where the 1 would
          normally be and push the tab button again. This button also allows
          you to continue typing once you've reached the hard right margin.</p>

          <p>Even though its use is probably gratiuitous, i love being able to
          set a tab on my typewriter. It works nicely and feels re-assuringly
          mechanical.</p>

          <h3>Shift</h3>

          <p>Caps are implemented via a 'basket shift' which basically means
          that by pressing the shift key, you are moving the entire set of keys
          up so that the caps version of each key makes contact with the paper.
          This is sort of the same concept behind also typing in a different
          color. anyhow, In my case, using the shift for some letters proves to
          be somewhat sticky and works 'most of the time' but often i am left
          with THe or MArcos on the page.</p>

          <p>Something i was completely oblivious to, having used word
          processors and computers most of my life (oh my), were the details
          about making things like exclamation marks or other bizzare
          punctuation. An exclamation mark is made up of a single quote and a
          period right over each other. Umlauts over letters are made by
          putting double quotes over whatever letter needs the umlauts.</p>

        <h2>quirks</h2>
        <div class="copy">
          
          <p>When i first bought this typewriter, it was advertised as a
          <em>Lettera 35i.</em> I searched in vain to find anything about
          that particular model of typewriter only to find nothing at all.
          That is because on the label on the front of the typewriter the L
          is lowercase and is easily mistaked for a fancy looking I.</p>
