        <p>There are two fundamental styles of teaching. One emphasizes
        concepts over mechanics and the other does the opposite. I have been
        told that the nature of teaching children necessitates teaching
        mechanics over concept: students gravitate towards the tangible and the
        readily accomplished task before they can grasp it's structure.</p>

        <p>This idea is not particularly surprising in itself, and it does not
        lack validity. What it does lack, however, is appropriateness. We
        assume that the larger concept is the one that must be taught when in
        reality that concept is made up of other, smaller, equally important
        tenets.</p>
