        <p><q>The new MIT logotype has evolved since the early days of MIT. <a
        href="http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/symbols/logo.html">[1]</a></q></p>

        <p>When i saw yearbooks inexplicably used as the image for that
        caption i wondered how Technique was connected. Why wait for an answer
        to that kind of question when you can answer it yourself?</p>

      </div>
    </div>


    <div id="main_content">

      <div class="subhead"> 
        <h2>Legitimacy</h2> 
        
        <div class="copy">

          <p>Originally, this page was going to appear as one of the main pages
          for Technique. However, i decided to co-opt the content i had made
          back into my own webpage. Here it goes.</p>
          
          <p>The <a href="http://web.mit.edu/psb/">Publishing Services
          Bureau</a> (PSB) and the associated <a
          href="http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/process/team.html">MIT I.D.
          Team</a> will be very explicit about the fact that what appears on
          this page <strong>is not</strong> the <acronym>mit</acronym> logo.
          Nevertheless, i feel that there exists a need, if only historic in
          nature, to preserve the <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">mit</acronym> logo that was in use
          until 2002.</p>

          <p>MIT website owners should feel comfortable using whatever graphic
          identity they choose, even if only for kitsch, historic or sentimental
          value. As the logo evolves, so must we remember its history. </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subhead">
        <h2>websafe logo</h2>
        
        <div class="copy">
        
          <p>Classically, the <acronym>mit</acronym> logo has consisted of two
          parts: the <acronym>mit</acronym> and the text "Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology". This is different than the <em>seal,</em>
          which you can learn about <a
          href="http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/seal/">here.</a></p>
          
          <p>The 90s logo is amazing because it is all text, which means that
          the <em>standards conscious</em> publisher can actually implement it
          as pure text that is styled with css instead of as a graphic. The
          clear advantage is that a user that has disabled graphics will
          <strong>still</strong> experience the substance of the logo as
          intended. Neat!</p>
          
          <p>Thankfully for the rogue publisher, the text of the 90's era logo
          is set in a demi-bold variant of Arial.  The slightest differences,
          you will notice, creep in Arial's lowercase <em>t</em> with its
          chiseled ascender and the weight of the font which is slightly too
          wide and just a bit too stocky.</p>

          <p class="acopy"><span class="alogo">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute
          of Technology</p>

          <p>The font purist may ask "What of Helvetica, Arial's superior
          counterpart?" Although Helvetica features a correctly shaped
          <em>t</em>, the problem lies in the fact that Helvetica is simply
          too tall and features an apparently non-uniform stroke in the M. </p>

          <p class="hcopy"><span class="hlogo">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute
          of Technology</p>
          
          <h3>code</h3>

          <p>To this end, the following may be used as an inline style
          definition for the logo. The problematic thing about this is that,
          obviously, it depends on the fonts Arial and Helvetica. In the worst
          of cases, the user will just see the words <em>MIT Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology,</em> but the effect will be lost.</p>

          <p>The following should go in the <code>head</code> section of your
          html page, or optionally it can go in your stylesheet. You can feel
          free to play around with these values, but the defaults are pretty
          good...</p>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  .base_logo{
    letter-spacing: .025em;
    font-weight:    bold;
    color:          #b10a21;
    font-size:      1.3em;
    font-family:    arial, helvetica; 
  }
  .logo{
    letter-spacing:-.03em;
    font-size:3.7em;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

          <p>This is the following html snippet that you can put in your
          webpages, it will make the logos you see above. If you don't like the
          words <em>Massachusetts Insitute of Technology,</em> then just don't
          use them.</p>

          <p>The <acronym>psb</acronym> makes it clear that there are two
          official <acronym>mit</acronym> colors. If you are using the Pantone
          color matching system, then you will use 201 for red and 424 for
          gray. </p>
          
          <p>For the web, however, the <acronym>psb</acronym> reccomends that you
          use #993333 for red and #666666 for gray. Web safe colors were all the
          rage ten years ago but are an antiquated holdover from those dark ages.
          Further, the colors in this combination look anemic at best.</p>

          style="color:#933">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
          
          <p>May i suggest the more lively  #b10a21 for red and #636363 for gray.</p>

          <p>I honestly forget if it's worth the hassle to live your life in
          websafe colors, but these days, i figure that most people that are
          designing with css and whatnot probably use plenty of web un-safe
          colors. But i could be wrong.</p>
