        <h3>Commencement</h3><!--date.2006.05.28-->

        
        <p>When I realized I was finally graduating, I decided to make some invitations. At first, I had hoped to get them letterpressed and use the fixed type size as some kind of challenge for myself, but the more and more I thought about it, I realized that I was way out of my element.</p>
        
        <p>The commencement design sprang from something I witnessed when I met up with my friend Sloan at Small Design, although common, it was gigantic word filled with other words repeated at smaller type sizes, kind of like the Acme 2001 signs I had made in high school. I decided to zoom in and accentuate the words by making them larger than the canvas and focusing on even smaller text within them. The feeling is somewhat overwhelming, but the idea is clear, like commencement.</p>
        
        <p>On May 24th, 2006 the graphic (sans name) appeared as the spotlight for MIT's homepage. I received several comments complimenting the typography and one that criticized the appearance of the word <strong>men</strong> three times on the graphic.</p>
        
        <h3>Carne Asada!</h3><!--date.2006.05.28-->
        <img src="images/lime.png" title="Carne Asada!" alt="carne asada invitation" />        
        
          <p>My sister's fiance is having a barbecue on the 15th of July and she asked me if i could design an invitation either suitable for printing or simply emailing. After  cutting limes for several weeks at my job, i readily believed that the single most defining culinary trait of any carne asada was the presence (and use) of those tiny limes. </p>
          
          <p>This invitation celebrates those little limes (and reuses their wedges for exclamation marks) and also marks my third use of the Helvetica Rounded Bold family. It is a little more vacant than i would like it to be, but it's just as playful as i would want it to be. Perhaps a failing in the design is the inability to maintain the 'writing within the wedge' motif which makes the contrast between both limes feel ad-hoc and chaotic.</p>

      <h2>Visual Identity</h2>

        <h3>Chickenfeed</h3><!--date.2006.05.29-->
        
        <p>During the Summer of 2005, I did some undergraduate research at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. While at the User Interface Design Group headed up by Rob Miller, I worked on Chickenfoot, a tool for automating web actions. When the project had become large enough, changelog entries began appearing on a blog and the design for the masthead was done by me.</p>
        <p>Note the use (oh no!) of Helvetica Rounded Bold Condensed! The masthead feels balanced, although the bits of feed feel awkwardly placed. I love the color scheme, it reminds me of san diego. Specifically, like a toned down mid-80s San Diego Padres theme. I'll say it here: brown is due for a comeback!</p> 

        <h3>Logo</h3><!--date.2006.05.28-->
        <img src="images/tef.png" title="Logo" alt="Logo" />
        
        <p>This is the second logo/identity package I have had the privilege of working on. Initially, having been exposed to perhaps too much of the media lab, I worked through a series of designs that were all too perspective oriented. The first design involved (predictably) a number of neutral colored planes floating in space, intersecting to make a T E F. The second was a red-yellow-blue colored three dimensional T E F where the surface of each letter was colored but the vacant space was left nonexistent.</p>
        
        <p>There was even an attempt to make the letters T E F appear within a perspective ocean, which visually accelerated towards a sun rising, or setting, i don't remember which. It made a nice sketch, but a terrible logo.</p>
        
        <p>Working with Kate Ricke, she finally encouraged me to think simple and generic; less complicated, more focused. The result was (predictably) something round, colored in a shade of bio-tech/haute cuisine blue. I used Helvetica Rounded Bold family for the first time, thinking it both approachable but equally authoritative. The three splines that intersect near the F are meant to represent dose-response curves, but are supposed to be a nice element in and of themselves. In February of 2006, the design was chosen, among others in a contest, as the foundation's logo.</p>

        <h3>How To Get Around MIT</h3>

        <img src="images/htgamitflat.png" title="How to Get Around MIT" alt="HowToGetAround MIT" />
        
        <img src="images/htgamitpage.png" title="Page Excerpt from HowToGAMIT 2005" alt="page section from HowToGAMIT" />


        <p>The first project that i was able to fully control the aesthetic of, was the <a
        href="http://web.mit.edu/htgamit/www/">HowToGAMIT</a>'s. In the summer of 2005, I
        was the design editor for the book and i contributed heavily to the
        book's completely redesigned layout, aesthetic, and its cover. Although
        i had made some actual HowToGAMIT icons and graphics, they never made
        it past some email reviews. </p>
        
        <p>Many people will note with some degree of spite and scorn that this
        is the first cover in about 18 years that does not feature the image of
        a hack. They can all cry me a river.</p>

        
        <p>I have tried to describe the cover to many people and the best i can
        come up with is this: Imagine that the book was designed by several
        sleep-adled folks, and now imagine that one of them sat down with a
        straight-edge and some graph paper and laid out the cover the way they
        used to do, pasting up pieces of printed type near each other, and then
        they tried taking a photo of the cover to send to the printer but some
        of the things on the cover started coming undone and they got a little
        off and some coverd others and stuff like that.</p>

        <p>That is, it feels like it was made many years ago, but is too clean
        to have actually been made many years ago. The cover shows off my
        fascination with one of the few fonts i legitimately own, Linotype
        Futura. The cover is done almost exclusively in Futura Bold. The cover
        also features the 'classic mit logo' that was in use up until 2002. The
        nice part is that it seems to fit well with the Futura Bold and has a
        gritty feel, as if we stamped it on each book and poster.</p>

        <p>The book, an excerpt of which appears on this page, was set in
        Legacy Sans. Almost every page has a margin/sidebar which contains
        useful information like hours of operation, T stops, and websites. The
        subheads were set in Futura Bold. Until it gets updated, the HowToGAMIT
        website shows what the previous edition's layout looked like, for
        comparison.</p>

      <h2>Business Cards</h2>

      <div class="copy"> 
      
        <p>During July of 2005 i started to get antsy about what i was doing.
        Mainly, i realized that i had no calling card or business card. I was
        stuck in the middle of an identity crisis!</p>
      
        <p>Out of this panic emerged two business cards.</p>
        
        <h3>MarcozOjeda</h3>
        
        <p>People criticize lots of other folks' designs. None however, appears
        to be as <strong>universally despised</strong> as the Verizon logo. I
        am no design guru, but i love cheeky designs and find this one
        amusingly subversive.</p>
        
        <p>People have told me that they hate this card, but i argue that they
        have no sense of humor.</p>
        
        <h3>No Parking</h3>
      
        <p>This is a design i have always wanted to make, at least, just a
        little. It is perhaps the best example of my obsession with
        <strong>generic</strong> items.</p>

        <p>The card is printed on vellum. I did my best with prototypes and
        used 80# laser printer vellum from the Paper Source. What's that you
        say? My weak 80# vellum is no match for your 85# card stock?</p>
        
        <p>Because i chose vellum for my card, i printed the majority of the
        'sign' on the back of the card and only printed my name and contact
        information on the front of the card. the effect is that the majority
        of the card looks 'dull' but that the name looks shiny and new. Take
        <em>that,</em> opaque people!</p>

        <p>I visited a restaurant in Central Square last year, sometime in
        December or so, maybe even later, closer to spring. Who knows anymore.
        I was taken with their attention to decorating the plate, in presenting
        an aesthetic feast as well as a culinary treat. And the food, well, the
        food, it was ok. It wasn't amazing, but it was savory and i enjoyed it.
        The Boston Globe reviewed the restaurant in July 2005, almost in
        August, and said it was like "dining at an apartment someone just moved
        into," which i would say is a good description of the restaurant.</p>

        <p>I took their take-out menu with me as i left and studied it when i
        got home. It was designed on a piece of legal-sized marigold paper as a
        quad-fold style leaflet set exclusively in Times New Roman.</p>

        <p>From a user interface perspective, the menu made close to no sense.
        I decided to take a stab at redesigning it. Starting by reading the
        whole menu, i finally got to work.</p>

        <p>My menu is set almost entirely in Adobe Caslon Pro, a gorgeous font
        with beautiful ligatures and old-style figures designed by William
        Caslon in the 1700s and redesigned digitally by Carol Twombley. I used
        Trajan Pro as the title font and used one of Zapfino's many fantastic
        swashes for decoration.  The menu is clean, simple, and elegant. I feel
        that it matches the essence of Pepper Sky's.</p>

        <p>But what about money? I never got paid for this because i was never
        hired by them. I did this job entirely <strong>pro-bono</strong> as a
        hobby and as a test for myself. I went by a month after i finished it,
        sometime in May of this year, to present the menu to one of the
        managers. I tried to explain i didn't really want any money for it and
        that they were welcome to use it. My friend Reid told me that this was
        my <em>mehta</em>, which is supposed to be something that you do out of
        the goodness of your own heart without expecting payment. Admittedly, i
        was disappointed that they never contacted me about using the menu. Oh
        well.</p>

      <h2>Posters</h2>

      <div class="copy">

        <p>I will be the first to admit that other people make better posters
        than i do. Usually. This is one instance where i think i really outdid
        myself. In contrast to the usually generic, nondescript, two minutes in
        inDesign posters that i often churn out, i spent time designing this
        one. On paper.</p>

        <p>The poster was made for <a
        href="http://web.mit.edu/yearbook/">technique</a> as a means for
        recruiting digital photographers. It is also my homage to <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold">Jan Tschichold</a>,
        whose <strong>Die Neue Typographie</strong> has theoretically been my
        current gospel (despite my inability to find it anywhere, shhh). The
        poster is formatted for an A4 page, not a standard 8.5x11" page because
        it has slightly sexier proportions.</p>

        <p>This poster's design is supposed to feel haphazard yet bizzarely
        organized. I <em>consciously</em> created distinction between type
        size, color and placement to actually impose meaning on an otherwise
        meaningless document.</p>
        
        <p>The font used is <a
        href="http://www.triskele.com/fonts/">Roadgeek</a>, a free version of
        the US Highway signage font, a slightly less abrasive version of DIN,
        for those who need comparison. I love Roadgeek because it is so tastily
        generic but also because the author put a lot of work into it, and i
        appreciate that too. It is also the same font i used for my street sign
        business card.  I believe this poster uses the 2W/2B weights.</p>

        <p>Download the <a href="pdfs/digital.pdf">pdf</a> of this poster if
        you'd like to read the nonsense text, or appreciate it closer to its
        actual size.</p>

      <img src="images/tnq05v.png" title="Technique Cover 2005" alt="technique" />
      <div class="copy">
        <p>I hate yearbook covers. For the most part, they are too pretentious. Sure, it's a yearbook, you only get about four of them in college, they're supposed to be meaningful, they're supposed to be about your school, &amp;c. blah blah blah.</p>
        
        <p>I designed the cover for the 2005 Technique as intentionally
        non-yearbook as i could get. I expected that most people would put the
        book away on a bookshelf, maybe in a box, somewhere. Maybe they'd look
        at it once, probably never look at it again. Who knows. I wanted the
        surly graduate to pick up the book one day and say from looking at the
        spine, <em>this right here was MIT</em>. Maybe a lofty goal.</p>
        
        <p>The cover is designed after one of my favorite books, <a
        href="http://store.yahoo.com/whitneystore/copuqsmandmi1.html">Cotton
        Puffs, Q-Tips, Smoke and Mirrors</a>, a Whitney Museum coffee table book
        that went along with the exhibit of the same name. What you
        can't really appreciate from the image to the left, is the cover
        material. It's a gray cloth with white foil stamped lettering. The
        process is slightly delicate, unfortunately, and is not particularly
        resistant to wear.</p>

        <p>The cover font is Futura Medium Oblique. It appears bold (and
        indeed, looks like apple's Futura Bold) because i added a 2 point
        stroke to the letters. I was hoping to preserve the N in Technique that
        pierces the baseline and the height of the ascender so tastefully.
        Unfortunately, Linotype's Futura does not have the happy fi ligature
        that features so nondescriptly in apple's rendering. Finally, the word
        Technique was placed close to the edge to instill some kind of tension
        and also because i was (secretly) hoping the E might actually get lopped
        off along the way. </p>
