        <p>Recently I have gotten old and 'wise' enough to start buying good
        books.</p>

        <p>This list is not comprehensive, but it is a nice subset.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="copy">
  
          <p>Design books are half pornographic and half nonsensical. In the
          right context, a design book book looks like nothing more than a very
          pretty picture book and the other time it is pure genius! I never quite
          understood this concept until i read <em>enough</em> design books. I
          now understand the <em>raison d'etre</em> in a bizzarely uncertain
          capacity.  However, like art books, design books are only good if they
          resonate with you. These books have all resonated with me in a magic
          way.</p>
  
          <p>I divide my books on design in two categories,
          <strong>typography</strong> and <strong>design.</strong> These are
          fairly broad categories and the best of the books i own transcend these
          categories, although i try to  place them in the realm they are
          probably most comfortable in.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <div class="copy">
        
          <p>Robert Bringhurst's <strong>Elements of Typographic Style</strong>
          is my first and still favorite book about letters. It is half about the
          design of a good book and it is half about the <em>use</em> of letters.
          While it does prescribe methods and strategies, it attempts to balance
          the strict nature of typography with its underlying artistry. The book
          is both abstract and precise in equally useful parts and serves as an
          excellent guide for the aspiring typographer.</p>
          
          <p>Eric Gill's <strong>Essay on Typography</strong> is a different
          ballpark than Bringhurst's. It will not explicitly teach you anything
          about type in the traditional way you may be familiar with. Instead,
          Gill focuses on a bit of history, a bit of pedagogy and so forth. This
          book reads as a treatise on who and what is responsible for type and
          some intimate thoughts on tangentially related topics. Read this not
          for instruction as much as historical insight.</p>
  
          <p>Steven Heller's <strong>Education of a Typographer</strong> is a
          novel concept. Much like <a href="http://www.emigre.com/">emigre's
          magazine</a> the book collects essays, curricula and so forth from
          typographers, designers and other people in the field. The book is
          ambitious and refreshing. It will half speak to you and it will half
          enrage you. Because these ideas vary so much, it is often interesting
          to see who emphasizes what and who resonates with your opinions.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <div class="copy">

          <p>As much as i love typography, i eventually cave and buy a design
          book in the mal-formed hope that i will glean a  pearl of wisdom from
          it through osmosis or by direct copying. Because these books are
          <em>so</em> random in their 'goodness,' (from lame to gorgeous) i will
          describe them as best i can so you get the right impression.</p>
  
          <p>Derek Birdsall's <strong>Notes on Book Design</strong> is amazing.
          It is amazing for two reasons: it is gorgeously designed and it is
          amazingly practical.  I do not normally come across a book that manages
          to succeed at combining the two of those qualities. What seals the deal
          is his truly no nonsense approach to things. He does this without
          completely removing the magic from any of his pieces, so while
          everything is out for inspection, he manages to still show that there
          is still something artistic about what he has done. Effectively, the
          book serves as a friendly reminder of all the things one is prone to
          forget when undertaking a book. This book covers a bit of typography in
          its own right, but does not exclusively focus on it.</p>
  
          <p>Kimberly Elam has twice reinvigorated my love for design. I bought
          first her <strong>Grid Systems</strong> book and fell in love. The
          book, for me brought design away from the computer and back to paper,
          but gave me the mechanics and thought process needed to do so
          effectively. There are some faults, though. The book benefits from a
          good teacher or someone that will encourage you to explore your own
          design skills. Without the motivation or constructive and guiding hand,
          the book loses some serious steam. Try it on, but have a friend handy
          that you can learn with.</p>
  
          <p>The second of Elam's books (first chronologically) is called
          <strong>The Geometry of Design.</strong> It is less obviously a
          textbook but lacks none of the charm of <strong>Grid Systems.</strong>
          It was this book that encouraged me to buy a compass and ruler and
          re-learn the art of constructions. The book is fun to skim and neat to
          follow along with.</p>
          
          <p>Paired with <strong>Grid Systems,</strong> you <em>feel</em> ready
          to undertake a small design task in the 'right' way. The books aren't
          exactly how-to books, they're more abstract than that. They're both
          historical but also practical. You can take from them as much as you
          want and the vellum overlays are both useful and fun to play with.</p> 
          
          <p>Recently i had a stroke of luck. I stumbled across Josef Alber's
          <strong>Intereaction of Color</strong> at Border's and snapped it
          up.</p>
