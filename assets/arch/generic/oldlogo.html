        <p><q>The new MIT logotype has evolved since the early days of MIT. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/symbols/logo.html">[1]</a></q></p>

        <p>When we saw our yearbooks inexplicably used as the image for that
        caption we wondered how Technique was connected. Why wait for an answer
        to that kind of question when you can answer it yourself?</p>

    <div id="main_content">

      <div id="basics"> 
        <h2>Legitimacy</h2> 
        
        <p>The <a href="http://web.mit.edu/psb/">Publishing Services Bureau</a>
        (PSB) and the associated <a
        href="http://web.mit.edu/graphicidentity/process/team.html">MIT I.D.
        Team</a> will be very explicit about the fact that what appears on this
        page <strong>is not</strong> the <acronym>mit</acronym> logo. Nevertheless, we feel that
        there exists a need, if only historic in nature, to preserve the <acronym>mit</acronym>
        logo that was in use until 2002.</p>

        <p>MIT website owners should feel comfortable using whatever graphic
        identity they choose, even if only for kitsch, historic or sentimental
        value. As the logo evolves, so must we remember its history. This
        website is a testament to the yearbook's pro-bono stance on cataloguing
        the myriad facets of <acronym>mit</acronym>.</p>
      
      </div>

      <div id="use">
        <h2>websafe logo</h2>
        
        <p>Classically, the <acronym>mit</acronym> logo has consisted of two parts: the <acronym>mit</acronym> and
        the text "Massachusetts Institute of Technology". Thankfully for the
        rogue publisher, the text is set in a demi-bold variant of Arial.  The
        slightest differences, you will notice, creep in Arial's lowercase
        <em>t</em> with its chiseled ascender and the weight of the font which
        is slightly too wide and just a bit too stocky.</p>

        <p class="acopy"><span class="alogo">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology</p>

        <p>The font purist may ask "What of Helvetica, Arial's superior
        counterpart?" Although Helvetica features a correctly shaped
        <em>t</em>, the problem lies in the fact that Helvetica is simply
        too tall and features an apparently non-uniform stroke in the M. </p>

        <p class="hcopy"><span class="hlogo">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology</p>


        <h3>Color</h3>
        
        <p>The <acronym>psb</acronym> makes it clear that there are two
        official <acronym>mit</acronym> colors. If you are using the Pantone color matching
        system, then you will use 201 for red and 424 for gray. </p>
        
        <p>For the web, however, the <acronym>psb</acronym> reccomends that you
        use #993333 for red and #666666 for gray. Web safe colors were all the
        rage ten years ago but are an antiquated holdover from those dark ages.
        Further, the colors in this combination look anemic at best.</p>

        style="color:#933">MIT</span> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
        
        <p>May we suggest the more lively  #b10a21 for red and #636363 for gray.</p>
