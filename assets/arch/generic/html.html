        <div class="copy">
        
          <p>When HTML started, it was supposed to provide two basic ideas:
          structure and linking. Beyond that, everything was supplementary.
          The big idea here was to make the source human readable and also
          match the structure.. Here is a minimal HTML document. It has an
          empty body.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; </pre>
    
          <p>While functionally, this document does absolutely nothing
          visually, it is successful in conveying its structure. Structure is
          critical in HTML. The following is an example of bad structure.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt; </pre>

          <p>But <em>why</em> is it bad? because there is
          <strong>ambiguity.</strong> The web browser will start reading:
          <q>here begins an html document, here begins its body, here ends
          the document.</q> But what of the body? did it end? Should the
          browser keep going until it reaches the end of the body? or should
          it stop at the end of the html? Both are valid options considering
          the error, so which takes precendence? If a web page programmer
          isn't able to decide this, how is a computer supposed to?</p>
          
          <h3>real world stuff</h3>
          <p>In HTML, each tag starts like this &lt;tag&gt; and ends like
          this &lt;/tag&gt;.  This rule pretty much holds across all HTML
          files. There's a caveat here, but we'll deal with it later.</p>
    
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="subhead">  
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <div class="copy">
          
          <p>HTML is broken up into two kinds of tags,
          <strong>structural</strong> and <strong>presentational.</strong>
          The critical point here is that structural tags apply a kind of
          importance to content. Text that appears inside a <em>paragraph
          tag</em> is a paragraph.  There is meaning there!</p>

          <p>Similarly, text that appears within a <em>heading tag</em> has
          meaning too, it is a heading, it has importance. There is meaning
          there too. By applying tags in HTML, you automatically give context
          to its content.</p>

          <p>While this discussion may seem bizzarely religious, it is
          important because it gets you thinking about how you structure
          text. Just like a well written paper, even the lowly HTML document
          should have structure that identifies its meaning.</p>
          
          <p>On to coding.</p>
          
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subhead">
        <h2>code</h2>
          
        <div class="copy">
        
          <p>Before we begin, let's make a cheat sheet of elements that we'll
          start off using.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li><code>&lt;html&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li>Body</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt;</code></li>
              
                <li>Body Content</li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Headings</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;...&lt;/h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;...&lt;/h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;...&lt;/h6&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Paragraphs</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>What really matters, for now, is the body content. Using this
          code that we have, we can make simple webpages that are capable of
          conveying structure. If you have used a language like LaTeX, then
          this series of tags is about equivalent to what you get in run of
          the mill TeX: headings and paragraphs.</p>
        
          <p>Let's see a sample HTML page</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is my very first webpage. It has a bit of
  everything. A little heading here. A little paragraph
  there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>This is pretty much what most html pages look like. They have a
          body and that's about it. Nothing too fancy.</p>

          <p>This is a good first start. Go off and make a webpage!</p>
