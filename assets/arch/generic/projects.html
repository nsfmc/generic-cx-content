        <p>This page currently houses little projects i work on. My email
        address is at the bottom of the page if you would like to ask me about
        any of them.</p>

        <div class="copy">
          
          <p>Web Browsing is easier with a table of contents available.
          However, the problem lies in <em>making and maintaining</em> a table
          of contents. this code remedies both problems. An example follows in
          the next paragraph</p>

          <p id="toc">toc: </p>

          <p>The previous paragraph, if you have javascript enabled,
          automagically generates a table of contents from the h2 tags along
          the page. No work required. You may update your page and the contents
          will update with it.</p>
          
          <p>You can download the javascript <a href="toc.js">here.</a> It will
          append a table of contents to any html element whose id attribute is
          <strong>toc.</strong></p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="subhead">

        <h2>notes</h2>
        
        <div class="copy">

          <p>In the textbox below, type whatever it is you'd like. After a
          delay of four seconds, the textbox will propagate its data into a
          list element right below the textbox.</p>
          
          <p>These notes do not get saved anywhere, except maybe your browser's
          local cache. In order to use this prototype, you need
          <strong>javascript enabled.</strong> More information follows after
          the example.</p>
          
          <form action="">

            <textarea id="ta" cols="35" rows="3" style="margin-left: 2em; border: solid
            1px black" onkeyup="updateWithDelay('note_list','ta',1000)"></textarea>
            
            <ul id="note_list">
            </ul>
          </form>

          <p>Once you have become comfortable making notes, you will probably
          want to <strong>edit</strong> them. Click on any note you've made to
          edit it. When you are finished with your edit, either Tab out of the
          textbox or click outside of it to <em>commit</em> your changes. Try
          it!</p>

          <p>The final implementation will save all the notes you type as
          successive <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">rcs</a>
          revisions of a given file. Because the notes are saved as a response
          to your edits, you can abandon the concept of saving altogether,
          instead focusing your energies on making new notes for yourself.</p>

          <p>An initial backend version of this software used PHP because it
          was convenient, but i am currently re-implementing the majority of
          the code in Ruby so that i can learn the language.</p>
