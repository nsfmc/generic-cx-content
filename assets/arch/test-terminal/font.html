thinker

     More recently, a friend of mine, mike pihulic, thought it would be funny
  if i made a font called 'thinker' that stopped after the letter A.  There's
  a joke there somewhere.

   Download the font: <a href="thinker.ttf">thinker.ttf</a>
   
kricket

   I started working on my very first font on June 28 2004.

   Download the font: <a href="kricket.ttf">kricket.ttf</a>

     The current version (1) has all the numbers, letters (upper and
  lowercase) and some punctuation.  It is not, however, properly kerned.  Wait
  for the next release...

     The font is based on the handwriting of my friend kate.  You can see her
  picture in the <a href="./showoff/" class="dir">showoff</a> dir, it's <a href="./showoff/kate.jpg"
  class="img">kate.jpg</a>.
     The name of the font is Kricket.  It is pronounced exactly like the small
  insect "cricket".  The name kricket was first coined by my friend deb.

  You can make your own fonts too.  Check out <a
