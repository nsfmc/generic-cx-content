<p>this key is signed by my previous key in case you think i am spoofing you (and if you happen to have my older key (see below...)). Still, because you may be indeed be suspicious, what follows is a signed message, signed by both my keys, just to prove to you that i control both (and this domain and my larger social presence...uhhh)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm moving on to 0x9B7C45A7 a 2048-bit rsa key and slowly migrating away from
0xF7BFB959, a fifteen(!) year old, 1024-bit dsa key.  I would prefer it if you
used 0x9B7C45A7 from 2014 onwards, but i will have the other one around for
some time.

Thanks for your trust,
- --marcos

<h2>what's this older key?</h2>
<p>Since 1998 i have been accessble via the following pgp key:
<dl>
  <dt><code>F7BFB959</code>
  <dd><code>F7E8 9F8B 5C10 1E21 9433  4D9D 06FB 8F53 F7BF B959</code>
</dl>
<p>You can still find this key if you look for it at pgp.com's <a href="http://keyserver.pgp.com/">keyserver</a>, but because this key was made during the heady days of the late 90s, it's a 1024 el-gamal/dsa key. practically speaking, as keys go, it will probably still be useful for some time.
<p>If you would like to disregard my prior wishes (or instead are trying to verify some email i sent you ages ago) you may download it: <a href="F7BFB959.asc"><code>F7BFB959.asc</code></a>. This one is signed by pgp.com's global directory verification key which has been emailing me dutifuly every few months for the past ten years or so.
<p>Still technology and time marches on, so although i'll still have access to that key, i'd prefer it if you used the newer one.
