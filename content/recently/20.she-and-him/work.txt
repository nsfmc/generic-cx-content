title: She & Him
-
content: 

I developed this site with the most excellent kate quinby of [croakandhum](http://croakandhum.com). 

For type, we're using Neutraface Titling via Cuf√≥n on the site's headings. The body text is Museo Sans 500 via @font-face. The disparity in delivery mechanism is due to licensing issues, but none of that should be apparent on the page itself.

For backend, the site is actually using tumblr via the api that i access from php. Using tumblr for the backend was something i'd really wanted to do for a long time and the site has the perfect content for it.
