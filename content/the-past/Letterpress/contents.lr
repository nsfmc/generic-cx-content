I enjoy letterpress work. 

The first image here is a business card that i made for my sister, printed using two sizes of foundry Tower on German Etching Paper.

The second is a quarto leaflet of hand-composited 10pt Monotype Garamond. The cover is printed using two magnesium plates. The text is from Helfand and Drenttel's eponymous "[Culture is not Always Popular](http://powerofdesign.aiga.org/content.cfm/drentell_helfand)"
