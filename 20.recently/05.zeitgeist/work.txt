content:  

This is a book that never existed. 

It was supposed to be the cover for a book of purely abstract, prototypical pieces of graphic design. I.e. graphic design recipes that gave instructions for how to produce other pieces of graphic design with similar mental structure but completely different aesthetic appearance.

The title of the book comes from a poster: This Season Be Sure To Keep In Mind The Power Of Zeitgeist
